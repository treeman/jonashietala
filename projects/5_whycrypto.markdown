I self-published a book! It tries to explain what cryptocurrencies are, what they're useful for, and why they exist in a very approachable manner.
It exists in [physical form][], as a [free eBook][] and it's [readable online][link].
The book on the website is created with [Pollen][] and [Racket][].
