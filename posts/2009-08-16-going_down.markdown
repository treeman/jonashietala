Ah my first game was so painless so I thought I could do any game I could imagine! Shooters, and mario bros kinda stuff. Well now I'm not so upbeat anymore, I've worked on this game for 7 days now and it's not playable at all. With seven days I don't mean a week, I've had a big break in the middle with no reason at all!

Anyway I realize I can't make the one week mark... which sucks... and the game isn't looking or feeling the way I want it too but I will release it when I've made it slightly less sucky.
