[I wrote][] that we where doing some microprogramming, making the processor work etc. We had a lab about that yesterday and I was very, very nervous. The preparations weren't that hard, but they where very bothersome. Converting the instructions to binary/hex by hand is never nice. Turns out the lab was very easy! You also had the option to prepare everything before on their simulator, which dumb be didn't do.

When I thought about how to describe what microprogramming is I was going to write that it's what makes a processor work. This sounds a bit off though, couldn't you do the same with physical hardware instead of another programming step inside the processor? Well turns out that's what RISC is all about. Sometimes the qualms you have when facing something new are completely justified.
