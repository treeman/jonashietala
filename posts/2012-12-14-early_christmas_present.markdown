School is almost over and it's almost time to travel back up to Övertorneå. This year me and Veronica opened our Christmas presents a bit early - we're impatient like that.

I got one of the best presents yet I think! A [Raspberry Pi][]!

*Just look at this bad boy!*

She got some crochet (virkning?) stuff from me, but she seemed content with that little. Now what shall I do with mine? I'm thinking of fetching a small screen for it and... and... Do something fun with it?
