So it's been what? Two, three years since I discovered the art of programming and I haven't made one single game?! Well now I'm not counting the visual basic nightmare *mastermind* I made a long time ago but a real game. Whatever that means. I've had these monster-projects;

+   *Point and click monkey island style adventure game*  
    The beginning c++ adventure for me. Kinda harsh start up don't you think? I thought so too - it never got anywhere near completion or playability.

+   *Another heavy game*   
    Think fully destructible environment. Need I say more?... No.

+   *The Game Engine*   
    The project everyone dreams of making games ends up doing and either discover it didn't amount in anything playable, which I did, or you'll end up thinking creating games is *extremely* hard and it'll take years for just a small game.

+   *The Dream project*  
    I've been thinking of making a few posts about the games in my dreams. Which I'll most certainly complete! Sometime... Maybe...?!

Somewhere about now I got interested in Indie games. I think [World of Goo](http://2dboy.com/) was the first but I'm not really sure. Maybe [armadillo run](http://www.armadillorun.com/) or *bridge builder*? Damn! I couldn't even google the link to [bridge builder aka pontifex 3](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=pontifex+3&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g2&fp=flbC24gbdiA) - all I found was a thousand torrent sites...

But what I did find was [kloonigames](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/), some guy who did the same thing I'm doing. Or I'm doing the same as him: following the footsteps of the [Experimental Gameplay Project](http://experimentalgameplay.com/). Making a game in 7 days, something surely impossible, and I haven't even made any game before! Oh crap! But as Petri (kloonigames dude) so elegantly put it:

> My experiences told my that creating, even a small, game takes months, if not years. So to do it in 7 days seem frightening. And not only the code, but graphics, music, sound, levels and all things included. I shit my pants even thinking about it and almost gave up. Luckily I realized that the worst thing that could happen (beside shitting my pants) was wasting a week of my life. I could do that easily with a Buffy the Vampire Slayer marathon.

And here's a summary of my first *ever* game **Balls**. It's available [here](/blog/2009/08/01/balls//) for download.

**The Good**

+   *I got it done!*  
    It seemed impossible and it scared the hell out of me. But I made it!! Aaah... It feels so good right now. And the game is actually pretty fun! It doesn't suck, it doesn't crash (but it's a bit buggy) and I can sort of say I managed to stick to my theme *Addictive Gaming*. Now with this over with I can focus on my next game. Not just now but in a while, now I'm confident to try new, bigger and hopefully better things and I know I can pull it off!

    I'm on top of the world! Nothing is impossible! Superman and Neo - you're just sooo jealous right now.

+   *It didn't even take long...*  
    I end up using [timelog](http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/general/timelog) from kloonigames to track my time. The game took **25,5 hours to make**, but I spent 7,5 hours of that time on a break! Either reading manga, playing cs or just surfing around and chatting. This isn't the time to nag about my lack of concentration and that I'm lazy, this is where I realize I didn't even work myself to death making the game. I could afford a break here and there, and now when I think about it they were really necessary.

+   *Pressure is good*  
    I did manage to implement some physics and collision detection, even though it's really simple. This was a first for me and I did it under a tight schedule! A coincidence? I don't think so, a small amount of pressure is really really good. It is during these times I'm most productive and I really do get things done *if I have to*.

**The Bad**

+   *The motivation didn't stick*  
    Although I made the game and it was pretty good I didn't even remotely invest as much time in it as I could - and I don't know why. I lost that super motivation pretty early in development and when I hit a bug or something that needed a lot of changing to implement I usually cut corners or just ran away screaming.

    Is this the every day life of a developer? If it's this though to get motivated wonder how you can motivate yourself working on a shitty project?

**The Ugly**

+   *The code*  
    Wow - I'm never showing the source of this to anyone! I tried doing the things which would make the game nearest completion, I did cut some corners but in the end the job is done. But it's really ugly and before reusing the code I'll need to clean it up a lot!

    What's that smell...? It stinks of smelly code!
