I've been playing [Starcraft 2](http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/) a little this christmas. It wasn't dead serious 1v1 which really is my favorite but I've played 2v2 with some friends and I actually played the campaign a bit and it was pretty fun! Usually I never play the campaign on RTS games but this one I liked. I even bought it to my little brother and he seems to like it.

But it's funny - yesterday when I went down to check on him he was playing *Rollercoaster Tycoon 3*!

One of my absolute favourite games (the whole series in fact) and that got me all nostalgic again. Tycoon games are so good; *SimCity*, *Theme Hospital*, *Rollercoaster Tycoon*, *Evil Genius* and more! I'm not surprised to see him playing this old game, I replay these games myself from time to time. I'm almost through *Theme Hospital* for the fifth time or something. You just don't seem to get tired of them you know.

Of course I'd like to make my own tycoon game. Not entirely unlike [Jonas IceCream Stand](/games/jonas_icecream_stand) but with actual building of course. I wonder how it'd look like though.

*evil genius' traps/base planning + rollercoasters + theme hospital's hilarity + simcity's economy = ?*

The best of the best games should make something good. That's only a theory though...
