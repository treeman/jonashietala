In December [I declared][dec-decl] that I would enter a [Bitcoin Cash hackathon][coinparty] and I was excited to give my procrastination a kick in the balls. Unfortunately the hackathon was postponed to January just an hour later. Maybe the organizers didn't think my project was exciting enough or something? Oh well.

It's January and I want to give it a try again! This time I got my friend to join me, but otherwise the project is the same. [The article I wrote last time][dec-decl] is still relevant, so you should go read that.
