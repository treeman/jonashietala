Here's my first ever experimental game! The theme was *Addictive Gaming*. My first thought was oh god I'll be making another tetris clone but the end result turned out a bit different. I'm not sure it's very addictive but it's actually okay! =D

Balls is a game about... balls. Well it's all in 2D so maybe Circles would be a better description but I don't think that captures the attention enough.

I didn't think this was possible but here it is! My very first jewel =)

**Instructions**   
Well... There's nothing to it really. Move the mouse over the balls to make them shrink, survive until the top is filled with balls.
