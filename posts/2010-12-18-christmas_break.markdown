So school is on a break and I welcome it with all of my heart. The semester has been pretty fun and I really enjoy studying here. We had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">lisp</a> the whole time which is a pretty sweet little language and if you haven't, give it a shot. Then we had math and I do like math, although I wasn't really motivated this time around and I dunno why. Maybe because I think I got it pretty fast and that didn't really motivate me to study when the test came around and I got far too many dumb mistakes I think.. Not good, not good.

Speaking about math then I took an extra course, mathematical statistics or something funky like that but meh it wasn't all I thought it'd be. In fact it was almost a bit boring and when I got problems with my stumach again (dunno why, but I think it has to do with stress or my irregular eating patterns, or both) so I kinda dropped it. But nothing's really missed: we're gonna have something similar later on anyway.

Now I haven't made anything game related in a while which sucks. A month ago or something I was poking at some prototype but it hasn't gotten anywhere yet. I was going to enter [ludum dare 19](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) but then I kinda just didn't, and now it's too late to do anything. And I have like a thousand ideas I'd like to do, but I don't seem to have done anything.

Argh!

And then there's my other programming interests of course. I've been poking at Haskell a few months ago but now I actually want to *learn* the damn language and the best way to do that is to make something real from scratch, so I've started my own (atm extremely simple) irc bot. Then I've bought the classical K&R C book and some book about Erlang and I'd like to get going with those too.

Add to that we're gonna do Ada in school after christmas which could be pretty darn fun too. There's surely not a shortage of stuff to at least!
