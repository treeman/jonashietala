title: "Fun or Frustration? Ludum Dare 33"

One of [my goals this year][] was to participate in a [Ludum Dare][]. I have cleared up my schedule, negotiated with my better half and everything is set up for epicness.

At first the idea was to make a game in [rust][], even tough I basically haven't used it in almost a year, but when I tried to set things up (yes today) it was extremely frustrating. Not so much that I couldn't write rust code but more that documentaion for the game engine I used was lacking. In the end I decided to skip it as I couldn't get sound to work.

In a bit of a hurry I went back to what I've used before. I still couldn't get the sound to work but I'm suspecting faulty sound libraries in my linux setup.

* **Language:** C++
* **Framework:** [SFML][]
* **Graphics:** [mtPaint][], [Inkscape][], [Krita][] (one of them at least?)
* **Sound:** [bfxr][]

As usual I will do it by myself. The goal is to make a simple reasonably complete game. The source code will be [on github][ld33] where I have a small code skeleton which I can use as a starting point.
