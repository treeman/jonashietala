Finished and uploaded our java game [Grand Thief Arto](/blog/2011/10/19/grand_thief_arto/), done an exam (didn't quite go as intended) and starting some new courses in school. I'm liking my choice of Computer Science more and more. *Data structures and Algorithms* was a super fun course, I actually ordered a [new book about the subject](http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0070131511/) just yesterday. *Linear Algebra* is really fun now as we're getting deeper into it and we're looking into assembly and processor structures now too. *Awesome*. I can't believe I considered doing physics or electronics when I could take these courses. Now if I only could do operating systems, compiler construction and language design...

In the meantime I've finished [Design for Hackers](/blog/2011/09/16/design_for_hackers) and it was a really nice book to be honest. I never knew there was so much about design and now I keep noticing funky stuff like what font a particular website is using, what colors and how they direct the reader. I also see a lot of inadequate stuff on my page and I have a few things I'd like to try.

I also read [Watchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen), the comic, and it was absolutely wonderful. Sadly I saw the movie before but, naturally, the comic was a lot better. So wonderfully dark and ah... Simply awesome.
