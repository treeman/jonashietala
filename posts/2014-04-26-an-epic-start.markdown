Oh what a mistake. I woke up at 05.00 when my girlfriend woke up, she's working early today, and went to the bathroom. After I was done, still pretty tired, I made a big mistake. I checked the current theme for Ludum Dare 29: **Beneath the Surface** and guess what? Now I wasn't tired anymore.

So I got out of bed, at 5!, and wrote down some ideas. Now, almost 2 hours later, I've had a battle with my makefile and I've written a lazy resource management system and a simple state transition scheme. A bit annoying as my previous fast prototyping framework already had all those ready, but in the end I got a bunch of coding done and it's not that big of a deal anyways.

My idea for the theme is far too big of course. Hopefully I'll have something to show off in the end. But now I need to eat some breakfast and maybe go sleep an hour or two...
