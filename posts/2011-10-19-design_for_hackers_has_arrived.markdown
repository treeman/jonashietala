It's here! After about a month of waiting I've finally gotten the book that will make me a design god! Or at least make me *aware* of something called design. Joking aside I'm really terrible at design and making things look good. Admittedly my programming art for my games has gradually improved but I honestly don't know what I'm doing, I just mess around until I get something decent. Maybe this can be a small aid? I even have some websites I want to design, and while I'm at it I want to try the [Perl web framework mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us/) which looks totally awesome!
