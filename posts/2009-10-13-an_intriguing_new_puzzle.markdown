Here's another game made for the [experimental gameplay project](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/):

[Slidoku](http://frankforce.com/?p=1246) which is a sort of mix between Rubik's cube and sudoku. I enjoy puzzles like those and I really enjoyed this one too - it took me a while to beat it but I just love the feeling when you do. If you like puzzles take a look, it'll be worth it!
