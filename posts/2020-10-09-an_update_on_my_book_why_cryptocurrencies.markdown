Five months ago I [gloriously declared that "my book was done"][done]. Since then I've been working hard to finish the book.

Sorry that's a bit of a lie, I've had a nice long vacation where I didn't work on the book and I'm also on part-time parental leave. And believe me there's not a lot of time left over with two kids pulling for your attention.

Although they won't be finished this year, I've made some good progress on the e-book and on formating the physical book and the goal is to have them ready some time next year. The plan is to release the e-book (PDF and epub) as pay-what-you-want for cryptocurrencies on my site while releasing it as normal on Amazon and similar.

I've also done a re-read of the book to make a bunch of fixes, so if you haven't read the book yet now might be a good time. It's [completely free to read online][book].

Because I started the book almost two years ago (yikes!) there are some new events that I've added:

* As a response to COVID-19, [the FED has printed an extreme amount of money in a very short time][print], displaying the problem with unsound money for all to see.
* [Lebanon became to second country to experience hyperinflation in 2020][lebanon] (Venezuela didn't escape theirs).
* [The U.S. court declared that the mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal][snowden].
* The extradition hearing against Assange, where the U.K. will decide if they should deport him to the U.S., [is a complete farce][farce]. For example the U.S. managed to convince the judge that any reference to the torture in Guantánamo couldn't be mentioned, so key witnesses were blocked from testifying and evidence were censored.

Yet I feel that nothing has really changed. The argument for cryptocurrencies are the same as two years ago, and they're only growing stronger.
