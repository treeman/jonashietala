Every now and day blog posts about what it takes to be a good programmer or how you figure out if someone is a bad programmer arrives. There's always talk about how you find the good programmers in interviews and the topic is always hot in schools and universities.

Today I read the best comment so far about the topic by [Hacker News][] regular edw519:
