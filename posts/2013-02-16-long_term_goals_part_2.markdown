A few minutes after I wrote about my long term goals, in the shower, I realize I forgot a few major goals I have:

Write my own Programming Language
==================================

Why? Because it sounds fun and epic as hell.


Write a Book
=============

So I like books and I like to collect them and I have my whole bookcase filled with programming books, manga and fiction. Something really cool would be to have a book with *my name* on it! So I wanna make that a reality.

I think I wanna write a programming book, what else could I write about? Fiction? Nah, I don't have enough imagination and my writing isn't good enough for that. A self-biography? Nah, my life isn't that interesting I'd say. Programming is fun and it's something I feel relative confidence in, so I suppose that's set then.
