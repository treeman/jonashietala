Five days of school now and things are starting to settle down a bit. The courses are pretty cool; we have linear algebra which is pretty interesting, we have a java course where we're going to make a game (!) and one about structures and algorithms. Pretty promising but we'll see how things pan out.

Taekwon-do practice has started and it's awesome. In the beginning it's so hard so I always wonder why I continue, but in the end it's really fun and it feels good after. If you haven't tried it you really should, or some other martial arts cause it's pretty cool. 

It's a perfect training for both mind and body. You might think it's just mindless hardship thanks to all the martial arts movies/anime/manga with crazy training, but you're also training your awareness, your creativity and decision making and more. Especially when sparring it's absolutely paramount that your head is with you, doesn't matter how fast or strong you are, if you don't fight with your head you're pretty screwed. That's what I really like about it, it's a pretty smart training.

  <em>Easy! Or maybe not?</em>

What I don't like however, and this is totally unrelated to anything, is the rain! I went to school five days and I got soaking wet *five* times! Hrblr... That's why I've decided to do absolutely nothing today, I might watch some GSL and read a bit. I've got [Learn you a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), [Effective Java](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/) and [Thinking in Java](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Java-4th-Bruce-Eckel/dp/0131872486) who can hold me company a bit.

And then there's Taekwon-do training of course!
