Happy New Year, Everyone! 2009 was great in many ways; I drove a submarine (yeah quite literally), I released 6 experimental games and recently I discovered the completely amazing game *Evil Genius* but lets try to make 2010 even better! 

So let's forget our small mishaps (yes I'm looking at [you](/blog/2009/12/04/december_theme_new_world_order) - December month without a game) and roll out a new theme. As usual I'm following The Experimental Gameplay Project's theme which happens to be *100 Things*.

And Things could mean anything from sprites, sound effects to pixels or enemies.
