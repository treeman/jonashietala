This was supposed to be a productive week with lots and lots of Perl and Ada but instead I've had this big headache all week, and some the week before and it's gotten pretty bad so I can't really concentrate on anything really. The electronics assignment was a bitch and it took a looong time to complete, even if all I had to do was to rewrite some stuff. You just love when the result is completely wrong just thanks to a misplaced minus sign.

So now I'm a bit worried, luckily not as much as my girlfriend, and what's the cause of this? The lack of water is probably the source of 90% of my headaches but now when I drink and drink it only eases of a bit and then it's back. Painkillers help a bit but I don't want to turn into a junkie just to be able to act normally.

Luckily I think I've found the reason, but sadly it's not the very best one. I think I need glasses. I squint *all the time* in front of the computer and I'm getting headaches when I'm reading. So this Friday it's judgement day. I dunno what I'm hoping for, if it's glasses then fine at least it should be better, but if it's not then it might be a bigger problem somewhere.
