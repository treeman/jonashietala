I decided to participate in the [Ludum Dare][ld] this time, even though I've spent the whole day on a massage course (which by the way was pretty darn good), and about halfway there this is what I've done:

All is not what meets the eye though, I've got the basics done with fully scriptable islands and actually the very basic gameplay too. Now it's just the blows and whistles left (meaning it's about 90% left).
