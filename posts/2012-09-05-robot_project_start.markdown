So it has begun, the long road until christmas when we're supposed to have a working warrior robot. We're gonna do battle with infrared lasers instead of axes but it might be fun anyway. Luckily for me I'm responsible for software and nothing harder than that! w00p!

Our group seem pretty good, all nice guys (so far!) and we have guys on the harder jobs - documentation responsibilities and project leader - so it *should* go well. We'll see!
