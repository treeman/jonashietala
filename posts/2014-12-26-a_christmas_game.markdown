I'm going through a bit of a boardgame stint, as I usually do during christmas time. I had exactly one thing on my wishlist for this christmas for my little brother: [Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries][]. Guess what? I got something from my wishlist!

This was our 5th or 6th game (or something?) and it's a nice piece of game! Much simpler than [Agricola][] and [Terra Mystica][] (our current favourites) but still with a healthy dose of decision making. It's a fun and straightforward game.
