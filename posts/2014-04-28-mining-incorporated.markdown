I made a very serious attempt at making a grand game for [Ludum Dare 29][id]. Unfortunately it was a far, far, too big of a game for me to be able to finish it in one weekend. But I had a great experience and was fun beating the procrastination devil for once.

Anyways, this is the state of the game as it is now.

**How to play**  
Choose a room, drag to build things. You must build where the worker starts. If you want more workers you need to build more beds. They can be placed anywhere. To gain money you must build or mine on an ore patch.
