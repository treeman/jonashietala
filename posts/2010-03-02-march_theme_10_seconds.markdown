Well well here's something interesting. [The Experimental Gameplay Project](http://experimentalgameplay.com/blog/) has given us a really interesting thing to focus on: Time. Like *Braid*, it's time for us to make something interesting with time itself. 10 seconds is the constraint and that's not a lot, but perhaps enough?
