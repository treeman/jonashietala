I read a [great essay or article][printf] about stereotypical programmers called [The Little Printf][printf]. I really couldn't do it justice so do yourself a favor and go read it. It touches on several types of programmers or rather traits of programmers I recognize in my surroundings and also sadly a bit in myself.  I can especially relate to the programmer who's always chasing the new hot technology or the one who's collecting cool but unread programming books, although I'm not doing it for the street cred.

And then there's the e-sport fan who watches other play game instead of playing them and again I'm guilty.
