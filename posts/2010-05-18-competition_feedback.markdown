The voting is over and I got a few ratings I want to comment on. You can view all ratings and comments [here][ld].

They're all from 1 to 5.

**Innovation: 3.75**   
This is by far the most positive of the bunch and the one button timing combination worked great!

**Fun: 3.29**   
Again a good grade and I thought the game was fun although it became really frustrating.

**Theme: 3.17**   
The islands wasn't very prominent in the game and the game could've been about anything really, but again I'm more than happy with the grade.

**Graphics: 2.54**   
Very simple and with some more effort it would've been better. But I'm happy, programmer graphics ftw!

**Audio: 2.14**   
I only had two click sounds but still got fairly high. Many decided not to vote on it and I wouldn't either. They were just last minutes add-ons but good to see someone liked it.

**Humor: 2.54**   
I didn't focus on this at all but got some decent grades from it anyway. Not sure if my graphics are *that* ugly.

**Overall: 3.13**   
The most prestigious grade and it's okay. I'm absolutely happy with it, especially since my desperate hope was to get *something* playable out of this.

**Community: 1.64**   
The community rating is for posts and stuff over at the Ludum Dare homepage. Sadly I didn't spend time there, almost at all, so I can't really say anything about this.

Overall I'm really happy with everything and I'm really happy with my relatively good grades.

I will do my very best to make my next game even better, but atm I can't seem to decide which idea I want to work with (I have like 4-5 serious ideas I'd want to explore).
