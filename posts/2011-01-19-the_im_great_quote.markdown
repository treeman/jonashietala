A new semester at the uni and so far it looks promising; I got a hold of some new books even though the bookstore had a snakelike queue similar to the [Jörmungandr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr) (the snake that encircled the earth in nordic mythology) and our new programming course started. This time it's Ada's turn and as always it should be interesting. At a first glance it doesn't look like it's introducing anything completely new from what I'm used with. I guess it looks like a cross between C and Haskell's type system spiced up with some other stuff. 

It's funny how I notice all these little, syntactic similarities (haven't done anything real with the language yet so I'm a bit shallow now but whatever) from different languages. It was a long time ago I came across a language that distinguish between functions and subroutines. I think that was the case with Visual Basic, my oh so dear first language a few years ago. Might've been five years ago?

Anyway quite enough of that, I don't want to derail too much. What I really wanted to write about is when our new teacher, who by the way is completely awesome, asked us who thought they were a great programmer. Most of us laughed it off but I think there were two, maybe three, who raised their hands.

I thought about raising my hand, but who do I think are great programmers? [Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), [Thorvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), [Djikstra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djikstra), [Stroustrup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) [Silverman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Silverman) and [Carmack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_carmack) comes to mind. They're probably not the greatest, but they've done some really notable things. Do I think I'm at their level? What a laugable question, I'm *miles* away. And I'm sure there's some [epic bearded fellow](http://www.codethinked.com/post/2007/12/06/The-Programmer-Dress-Code.aspx) somewhere out there who's even higher on the programming skill ladder.

Now what is a great programmer then? I have no idea. But I do know that with all the things I don't know, I couldn't be one. Sure I've done something in about 10 different (some not so different) languages. But there are [hundreds more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages). I've done nothing low level, I have no experience with op codes or assembly and I'm not up to date with the latest scripting languages. There are a few new interesting languages like [Rust](https://github.com/graydon/rust/wiki/), [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) or [Go](http://golang.org/) which I haven't even looked at yet. Of course the number of languages you know doesn't make you great, but it just feels like I'm missing stuff.

Sure these guys could be great - who am I to say otherwise? But you'll have to wait a long time for me to spill the I'm great quote. Hell, maybe even a lifetime?
