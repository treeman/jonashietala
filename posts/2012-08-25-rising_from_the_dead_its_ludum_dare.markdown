I've been a long time gone, been busy with school then having summer vacation and generally not making games or blogging. But I have revived! I scrambled to push my new website live because today it's Ludum Dare time! The theme is "Evolution" and it's the 24th time for Ludum Dare and my 4th time entering.


Of course, as usual with my Ludum Dare entries I'm totally unprepared. I haven't used any of the tools I'm going to use in over half a year or something.
