While working on [Jonas IceCream Stand](/blog/2009/12/01/postmortem_jonas_icecream_stand) I took a screenshot every day and I thought they looked pretty cool so here they are:

    <img src="/images/games/art/day1.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>
<a href="/images/games/art/day2.png">
    <img src="/images/games/art/day2.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>
<a href="/images/games/art/day3.png">
    <img src="/images/games/art/day3.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>
<a href="/images/games/art/day4.png">
    <img src="/images/games/art/day4.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>
<a href="/images/games/art/day5.png">
    <img src="/images/games/art/day5.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>
<a href="/images/games/art/day6.png">
    <img src="/images/games/art/day6.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>
<a href="/images/games/art/day7.png">
    <img src="/images/games/art/day7.png" height="100" width="160" />
</a>

And now I'm off with [New World Order](/blog/2009/12/04/december_theme_new_world_order) and (for once) I've got a really really good idea!
