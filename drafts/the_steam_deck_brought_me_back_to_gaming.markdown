title: "The killer features of the Steam Deck"

In the beginning of the year I gave myself a late Christmas gift and bought a [Steam Deck][] for myself.
There were two main reasons I decided to buy it:

1. I wanted my kids to play games instead of passively consuming endless amounts of YouTube.
2. I wanted to combat my [burnout and depression][] by picking up gaming again.

And boy did it deliver.
The Deck is probably the most impressive thing I can remember buying since... I don't know, maybe my first smartphone?

I think it impresses me so much thanks to these five killer features:

# Killer feature #1: Sleep mode

For me, as a father of three where my gaming time is very limited and can be interrupted at any time, the one truly outstanding feature of the Deck is the sleep mode.

It works like this:

1. Press the sleep button, and the Deck will turn off in about a second.
2. Press the sleep button again, and the Deck will turn on and resume exactly where you were, in a second.

This has worked perfectly for me for every game I've tried.
And it's revolutionary.

It's no exaggeration to say that without this one feature, nothing else could've allowed me to find time to game.
The ability to instantly put it down and go to the screaming baby has been crucial,
and being able to instantly teleport myself back into an immersive gaming experience has been fantastic.

If you're a parent who want to game, this is the feature you've been waiting for.
If a gaming device doesn't have this, don't bother.

# Killer feature #2: The steam library

The second feature I want to highlight is access to [Steam][].
It's the largest distributor of PC games by a wide margin, and the amount of games available on the platform should be enough for anyone.

To be sure, the Steam Deck is a handheld and won't be able to run the most demanding games and it also runs Linux so it will have compatibility issues with a lot of games.
But the device is surprisingly powerful, and the work Valve has put in to make [Windows games work on Linux][ProtonDB] is astounding, so a lot of the games will just work.

Just to give you a taste, here's a variety of games that are installed on my Deck that all work great:

## LEGO RPGs

LEGO City Undercover / LEGO Star Wars / LEGO Jurassic Park

## Overcooked 2
## Forza Horizon
## Ninja Turtles
## Faster than Light

![Flagship goes boom.  
Make no mistake, this game is **hard**.](/images/ftl/stealth_b.jpg)

I rediscovered one of my favorite games of all time, and [spent 231 hours to beat it on hard with all the ships][ftl-ships].

## Horizon Zero Dawn
## Parkitect
## Grim Dawn

# Killer feature #3: Steam input

You may have noticed that I listed some games you wouldn't think worked well on a handheld.
Parkitect for instance heavily relies on the mouse, and Faster than Light is a decade old game that's also mouse based and doesn't have an gamepad specific mappings.
What gives?

With [Steam Input][] the Deck allows you to remap any key or command to whatever input you want.
Combine that with the Deck's excellent trackpads and you can comfortably play any game (well, maybe not RTS games or FPS games like Counter-Strike).

As an example here's my inputs for FTL:

- FTL inputs

Some notable features to mention:

- In FTL there are two pause buttons (space bar and mouse middle click). By pressing them quickly in succession you can [micro pause][FTL-micro-pause] and advance the game just a few frames. I've bound a single button on the Deck to do this, with a 100ms pause between.


# Killer feature #4: An open platform

What first got me excited about the Deck was actually that the Deck might represent the first big leap forwards in making Linux a valid gaming platform.
And thanks to [Proton][ProtonDB] I think that's absolutely true, but the real value for the Steam Deck owner is that it's an open platform and you can do what you want with it.

- Want to **use other game stores**?

  Sure!

- Do you want to **install native Linux games** not on Steam, like [Veloren][] or [Clone Hero][]?

  They work great!

- Want to **watch a movie** instead of gaming?

  Launch desktop mode and it's just a regular computer.

- Don't want to bring your laptop, but **need to do some development** on the go?

  Bring your keyboard (and probably a dock to connect to a screen) and it's as good as the laptop.

- Do you just want to **install Windows**?

  Absolutely. Do you want to install it on the SD-card or on the Deck itself?

I'm a strong believer in that you should be allowed to do whatever you want with your devices, and with the Steam Deck you can.

# Killer feature #5: Emulation

The last feature I want to bring up ties into the previous: the Steam Deck is an amazing platform for emulation.

I've never emulated anything before, but it was very easy to setup using [EmuDeck][].
The device itself is powerful enough to run basically any older game, and even many popular Switch games.

You may ask, if Steam already has tons of games, why bother with emulation?

I've got a few reasons:

1. Many good games aren't on Steam (Nintendo, I'm looking at you).
1. Nostalgia.
1. Experience the classics.
1. Some gaming experiences aren't replicated well by the newer styles of games.
1. If you look at the many "best games of all time" lists out there (which I did when I asked myself what have I been missing out on) you'll find that a lot of them are from older systems.

For example, maybe you've heard of **The Legend of Zelda**?
I have, but I've only ever played a single game (Link's Awakening).
This is super unfortunate because some of the Zelda games are rated as the best games in history.

But if you want to play through the Zelda series you'd have to collect almost every Nintendo console.

Or you can play *the whole series*, including the newest Switch games, on the Deck.

I admit this is a contrived example because I haven't done this yet (I plan to play through the most popular ones at some point), so here's a list of games that we've actually played:

## Mario Kart 8 Deluxe

Both of my boys (5 and 3 years) love Mario Kart.
The best feature is probably the driving assist, so the younger kid can play even if all he does is press the jump button and shout.

## Super Smash Bros

Mario Kart has been our most played game, but it's quickly being overtaken by Super Smash Bros that my older boy has been playing non-stop for weeks now.

But I understand him, it's an awesome game and it was my favorite Nintendo game when growing up.

## Donkey Kong

I wanted my kids to learn platformers as well.
They aren't sold on them yet, but Donkey Kong is a pretty neat game.

## Punch Out

Punch Out is pure nostalgia for me.
Amazing.

## Pokémon Unbound

Speaking of nostalgia, of course I need to mention Pokémon.
I had difficulty deciding what Pokémon game to play---there are a few---and then I just happened to discover the rabbit hole of Pokémon ROM hacks.

According to my pre-study Pokémon Unbound is the best ROM hack there is, so that's where I started.
But there's *a lot* here to explore.
Maybe I'll get there eventually.

# Isn't there more to the Steam Deck?

There's absolutely more to like about the Deck. For instance:

- It's a handheld you can dock.
- The processor is very capable with the amount of power it uses.
- You can connect a lot of things to it. Controllers, fight sticks, Wii guitars etc.
- The trackpads are very good as a mouse replacement.
- The year of Linux has finally arrived!

While nice, they don't quite qualify for my killer features list.

And most importantly, I wanted to keep it simple and only select five killer features.
