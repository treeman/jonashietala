# Why another printer?

# Why a VORON 0?

# The kit

## Lots of delays

I ordered a VORON 0 from [Lecktor][] in February and it took roughly 4 months before I got the _first_ shipment of parts and it wasn't until the end of 2024 that I had received all the parts needed to complete the build.

The wait was annoying...

::: warn
While I can't complain about the quality of parts, with the massive delays I regret ordering from [Lecktor][] and I would've been happier with an LDO kit from [3DJake][], like I was first considering.

## Printing parts myself

So what do you do when you can't start the build?

You print parts!

![A box of some of the printed parts for the build.](/images/voron_0/box_of_parts.jpg)

There's something very satisfying with printing parts you then build a printer with.

This time I wanted to make a colorful printer and I came up with this mix of filament:

- [PolyLite ASA Yellow](https://www.3djake.com/polymaker/polylite-asa-yellow)
- [Formfutura EasyFil ABS Light Green](https://www.3djake.com/formfutura/easyfiltm-abs-light-green)
- [Formfutura EasyFil ABS Light Blue](https://www.3djake.com/formfutura/easyfiltm-abs-light-blue)
- [Formfutura EasyFil ABS Magenta](https://www.3djake.com/formfutura/easyfiltm-abs-magenta)

## Adjustments made from the kit

* [Dragon Burner][] toolhead instead of the mini stealthburner
* A Rapido instead the Dragon hotend that came with the kit
* Added a Nevermore filter
* Replaced the SKR Mini E3 V2 with the V3


# The build

![](/images/voron_0/office_overview2.jpg)

I won't do as detailed of a build log as I did when [building the VORON Trident][] but I tried to take some pictures.
Scroll on!

## Frames and bed

![The linear Y-rails](/images/voron_0/assembly_start.jpg)

![The kit comes with the [Kirigami bed mod][].](/images/voron_0/kirigami_assemblqu.jpg)

![The frame with A/B motors.](/images/voron_0/frame.jpg)

![Building the bottom of the printer with feet, power supply, and disply.](/images/voron_0/plate_upside_down.jpg)

## MGN9 instead of MGN7 X-axis

After I assembled the X-axis I noticed a problem:

![The carriage collides with the stock A drive](/images/voron_0/wrong_drive2.jpg)

The reason is that the kit comes with MGN9 rails for the X-axis instead of the standard MGN7 rails.
This required me to print modified A/B drives, X-carriage, and alignment tools.

![The carriage passes the modded B drive](/images/voron_0/wrong_drive1.jpg)

## Belts

![Starting to install the belt.](/images/voron_0/belt_routing.jpg)

![The belt is *tight*.](/images/voron_0/in_progress.jpg)


## Dragon Burner toolhead

I got the parts needed to build the standard mini stealthburner...

But I'm attracted to playing around with new stuff and I decided to try out the [Dragon Burner][] instead.
I went with it because it's quite popular, it has good cooling (I print a bunch of PLA), and I haven't tried it out yet.

![The fans are inserted.
I don't care about LEDs so I inserted an opaque magenta part instead.
I think it looks really good.](/images/voron_0/dragonburner_front.jpg)

![The back of the Dragon Burner.
I opted for the [Rapido 2][] instead of the [Dragon][] that came with the kit because the [Dragon][] has problems printing PLA.

![I was a bit confused on how to route the wires as there was very little space when mounting the toolhead on the carriage.
Routing the wires close to the fans, clipping off the ears of the fans, and holding together it with cable ties in this way worked for me.](/images/voron_0/dragonburner_cable_back.jpg)

## Galileo 2 standalone

![Dragon Burner together with the Galileo 2 extruder mounted on the printer.](/images/voron_0/dragonburner_mounted.jpg)

For the extruder I opted for the standalone version of [Galileo 2][].
I've [used Galileo 2 on the Trident](/blog/2024/02/27/lets_build_a_voron_more_mods#Galileo-2) but I hated the push down latch it uses in the Stealthburner configuration.
The latch eventually broke by pulling out a heat-set insert so I went back to the Clockwork 2 on the Trident and rebuilt the Galileo for the VORON 0 instead.

The build was really fast and simple---compared to Stealthburner it's night and day.

![The parts for Galileo 2. There will be left-overs from the Stealthburner variant.](/images/voron_0/galileo_standalone.jpg)

## Filters

Of course, I need to have activated carbon filter and an exhaust fan with a HEPA filter in the printer.

### Nevermore

The [Nevermore V4][] is an activated carbon filter that fits well in the VORON 0.

![I fastened the fan using a strip of VHB---it was a struggle to position it in the middle.](/images/voron_0/nevermore_fan.jpg)

![The Nevermore is mounted standing in the side of the printer.](/images/voron_0/nevermore_mounted.jpg)

::: important
Just remember to preload the extrusion with extra M3 nuts when you assemble the printer.
(I've heard LDO has nuts you can insert after... Sounds great.)

### Exhaust

[tophat exhaust][]

## Panels

## Wiring

### Power

### Raspberry Pi

![The Raspberry Pi only has two cables; power and communication over the GPIO pins and a display via USB.](/images/voron_0/pi_zero.jpg)

![The Pi communicates and gets power over the TFT connection on the MCU.](/images/voron_0/tft_connection.jpg)

### Toolhead

The kit came with a toolhead board and breakout board for an umbilical setup:

![The toolhead board.\
I didn't use the x-endstop.](/images/voron_0/toolhead_board.jpg)

![The breakout board.](/images/voron_0/umbilical_breakout_board.jpg)

I did run into an issue where the polarity of the fans on the toolhead board did not match the polarity of the fans on the MCU, leading to some frustration where the fans refused to spin.
I ended up swapping the polarity using the cables from the breakout board to the MCU.

### Chamber thermistor

The MCU only has two thermistor ports and they're used for the hotend and bed thermistors.
For the chamber thermistor (that's integrated into the breakout board) I use the MOSI pin on the SPI1 8-pin header:

![The chamber thermistor connected to MOSI and ground on the SPI1 header.](/images/voron_0/chamber_thermistor.jpg)

### SKR mini E3 v3

I got an SKR mini E3 v2 with the kit but I replaced it with the v3 for two reasons:

1. An extra `FAN` output, used for the Nevermore Filter
2. A filament runout sensor

There's not much to say about the extra `FAN` output but the filament runout sensor has 3 pins, while VORON 0.2 style runout sensor has 3 pins.
I reused the prepared y-endstop I got with the kit, scratched away some of the plastic to make the 2-pin connection fit the 3-pins on the MCU (the +5V pin isn't needed):

### Neopixels

# Klipper setup

I followed the [VORON documentation][] and chose Mainsail as I've been happy with it on my Trident.
I'm not going to describe everything and only call out some issues I had or extra steps I had to take.

## MCU firmware

The [VORON documentation][] assumes USB communication so the default firmware instructions didn't work for me.

According to [BigTreeTech's documentation][] if you communicate over USART2 (the TFT port) then you need to compile the firmware with `Communication interface` set to `Serial (on USART2 PA3/PA2)`.
You then need to use this klipper configuration:

```
[mcu]
serial: /dev/ttyAMA0
restart_method: command
```

::: warn
It took a long time for me to figure out as I had a display connected via USB, so I thought the display was the MCU and got stuck at a `Your Klipper version is: xxx MCU(s) which should be updated: xxx` error.
:::

## Filament runout

## Chamber thermistor

According to [this comment][chamber] this is the config to use the SPI header for a thermistor:

```
[temperature_sensor chamber_temp]
sensor_type: Generic 3950
sensor_pin: PA7
pullup_resistor: 10000
```

It works!
