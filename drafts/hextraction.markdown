![A session of Hextraction, a 3D printed board game.](/images/hextraction_session.jpg)

I did it.
I made something actually useful with [my 3D printer][voron] instead of just tinkering with it.

I printed [Hextraction][], a very cool 3D printed board game for my kids---and they love it.

[Hextraction][] is a gamified marble run, where you place tiles and drop balls in order to reach the end without getting yeeted off the board.
It's kind of hard to explain it in text, so if you're still confused just watch the video from the creator.
He's hilarious:

(The first 20 seconds should give you a good idea of what the game look likes.)

# Keep it simple

While I ***love*** boardgames, I printed this game for my kids to enjoy.
Because they're still young at 6 and 3 years (our 1-year old have to wait) I had to keep the game simpler than I'd personally like.

You see, [Hextraction][] doesn't only use regular tiles that directs the balls, they also have special effect tiles that have special rules.
For example, with the [Teleport Tile][] you can restart your ball from another location or with the [Clone Tile][] you're supposed to roll another ball from that same tile.
The mind boggles with cool and interesting plays with these kinds of tiles...

But they all have their own specific rules that you have to remember or read on a rules card.
Having to constantly be reminded of rules isn't really fun, and our kids can't read Swedish let alone English yet, so unfortunately the special effect tiles must be ignored for now.

Other than that the rules we use are very simple:

1. Place a tile (out of a hand of 3)
2. Drop a ball
3. Draw a new tile

And if ever 3 balls (or more) get stuck on a single tile, you're allowed to remove one tile that the balls are touching.

(Oh, if a ball happens to bounce into a goal, that's ok and part of the game!)

# Boards

Before getting into the tiles---which is the meat of the game---let me first address the board, which is the structure you place your tiles into.

There's an [official board][] you can use, but I really didn't like it for one major reason:
the balls can easily drop off the board, onto the table and roll down to the floor where our 1-year old might find and try to eat them.

- A [modular board][] 
- The [super fancy remix][]
