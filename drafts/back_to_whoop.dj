I recently started to subscribe to [Whoop][] again after I canceled it around a year ago.
I was partly dissatisfied with my [Garmin watch][Garmin Instinct 2X Solar] as a fitness and health tracker and I also wanted a new tech device to tinker with.

The plan was to write a short post about what I like and don't like about [Whoop][] but as usual I'm struggling with writing shorter posts.

> If I had more time I would write a shorter letter.
> ^ Attributed to Blaise Pascal

The TLDR is that [Whoop][] is still expensive, still imperfect;
yet it's the most helpful smart device I've used
and a [Whoop][] in your underwear is the best way to track your heart rate while hugging spandex-wearing adults.

# A brief history of my experiences with smart devices

I'm not an elite athlete, not even close; 
I'm just a programmer who struggles to stay active.
As I also like to play with tech I've tried out various smart devices in the hopes that they can help me to live a healthier life
(with various levels of success).

Here's the devices I've used, in purchase order:

::: timeline
: Fitbit, -2020 .smartband

  I had some smartband from Fitbit that I liked.
  When that bugged out I bought the [Fitbit Versa][], with a square display.

: Oura ring, 2020-2021 .oura

  I wanted to track my sleep better, so I bought [a ring][Oura].
  It worked well.

: Garmin Venu Sq, 2020-2023 .smartband

  The Fitbit kept disconnecting, so I abandoned it for a [Garmin][Garmin Venu Sq].

: Oura ring Gen 3, 2021-2023 .oura

  I had to recharge the ring all the time so I upgraded to the newer version.
  (The battery of the new ring also deteriorated and I stopped using it when I had to charge it every 1--3 days.)

: Withings Body+, 2022- .withings

  I wanted to track my weight so I bought [a smart scale][body+].

: Polar Verity Sense, 2022-2023 .hrtracker

  I can't track my Submission Grappling training with a watch or a ring,
  so I bought [a heart rate monitor][Polar Verity Sense] you put on the bicep.
  It works.

: Fossil Gen 6 Wellness Edition, 2022 .smartwatch

  Maybe I should try a _real_ [smartwatch][Fossil Gen 6] with lots of smart features...?
  I use Android so maybe a watch with WearOS is good?

  Jokes on me, WearOS was garbage and having to charge the watch every day is a nightmare.
   I went back to the Garmin really quickly.

: Garmin vivosmart 5, 2023-2024 .smartwatch

  I wasn't happy with the [Garmin Venu Sq][] (can't remember why) and disappointed with smart watches I figured [a simple smart band][vivosmart] would suffice.

: Whoop 4.0, 2023-2024 .whoop

  I used [Whoop][] for a year.
  Tracking Submission Grappling with a device in my underwear is so next level.
  I can also wear it during weight lifting---say goodbye Oura!

: Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, 2024- .smartwatch

  Charging the devices got annoying; I found the [Garmin Instinct][Garmin Instinct 2X Solar]
  you only charge once a month and it comes with a _flashlight_.

  Seriously, you haven't truly lived before you've had a flashlight on your watch---it's glorious.
  (Jokes aside, it's awesome.)

: Eight Sleep Pod 4, 2024 .eightsleep

  Sleep is important so [I tried (and returned) a ludicrously expensive smart mattress][].

: Whoop MG, 2025 .whoop

  I was feeling down and I needed something to help me get back to prioritizing fitness and health,
  and I just happened to check back on [Whoop][] just when Whoop MG was released...

  So I threw financial responsibility out the window and ordered the MG on release day.
:::

Gosh, I've been good about not changing my phone that often but I didn't realize I've wasted so much time and money on smart devices...

Anyway I'm currently using the [Garmin Instinct 2X Solar][] as a "stay off my phone" device and [Whoop][] as my fitness and health tracker,
ignoring the Garmin's health and fitness tracking features except for sometimes glancing at the steps on the watch.

# The point is to change behaviours

While it's fun to look at statistics and graphs, the point of me buying all of these smart devices is to help me change my behaviours (in a positive way).
It doesn't matter if the device is super accurate or produces the most beautiful graphs God has created;
if it doesn't help me do things differently then the device is a failure.

Here are two examples:

1. My first Fitbit smartband was great.

   It's true that it was quite limited in what it could do.\
   The tracking of steps/calories/steps/etc was wildly inaccurate.\
   It also disconnected from my phone _all the time_ and it was super annoying.

   However, it presented the daily steps/calories/steps as bars on the screen---bars that I should fill over the course of the day---and that caused me to change my behaviours and to move more than I'd have done otherwise.

   (This is a feature in most smartwatches today but nothing I've tried captured the feeling as well as my very first Fitbit device.)

2. The Garmin Instinct is useful, but not as a fitness or health device.

   I think the watch is very nice;
   it's got a fantastic battery life,
   it's not bothering me when I sleep,
   I don't have to reach for my phone to see if I have any notifications,
   and the flashlight is _amazing_.

   > It’s just super effin’ functional and useful day-to-day, with just as much utility as the flashlight on your phone (if not more, since your hands are still free).
   >
   > ^ [DCRainmaker](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/05/flashlight-multiband-everyone.html)

   The Garmin also has lots of various measurements (and much more accurate than my old Fitbit);
   I can see the daily steps,
   I can follow how my "body battery" is doing,
   I can track walks or runs very well (although I don't run),
   and I can follow my stress and heart rate throughout the day...

   But that doesn't _do_ anything for me.
   I have all these bars and graphs and circles on the watch that I should fill to meet my daily step count for example, but I just don't.
   Maybe my neanderthal brain needs more colors or something.

   The Garmin app is also not designed in a way to help me get motivated.
   Maybe it's more geared towards athletes that already train hard every day,
   instead of middle-aged programmers who need that extra push to get out there?

   For whatever reason, as a device to improve my fitness and health, the Garmin is a failure.

# Why I left Whoop last year

About a year ago I chose to not renew my Whoop subscription and I [made a post on Reddit][] explaining why.

Here's a quick summary:

::: dash
* If I had the Whoop in my boxers it thinks I'm sleeping when I sit in front of the computer or lie in the sofa.

* No custom insights for the journal.

* The UI for the strength trainer portion of the app sucked.

* It's too expensive if all it provides is tracking for Submission Grappling.
:::

## Did I change my mind about these points?

::: dash
- Whoop still thinks I'm sleeping when I'm sitting with the Whoop in my boxers.
- Custom insights are nowhere to be found.
:::

::: plus
- I still dislike the strength trainer with a passion.
You can however start a Weightlifting activity and add the exercises after the training.
This is _much_ more manageable for me and it'll still calculate muscular load for you.
- I've also come to realize that after 10 months with only the Garmin watch it wasn't helping me improve my fitness or health in the
way Whoop used to do.
This is the main reason why I was willing to try Whoop once more.
:::

# Whoop screwed over their customers

It was an interesting feeling to visit [r/whoop][] after having placed my order
and see it overrun by people extremely upset about how Whoop was treating their existing subscribers.

I agree that Whoop displayed some real corporate bullshit by telling people to pay an upgrade fee despite claiming for years that upgrades would be free (then walking back on the upgrade fee somewhat),
claiming that the 6-month subscription requirement for new hardware was "a mistake on their blog",
and by breaking compatibility with the 4.0 bands.

Some people claim that Whoop broke the band compatibility intentionally but as I've experienced the same at work I think incompetence is more likely.

> I don't want to be constrained by the old design!
>
> ^ Programmer, before corporate disaster

It sucks but corporations screwing us over in various ways is more or less expected.
This whole situation made me regret resubscribing to Whoop so quickly.

# Thoughts on Whoop in 2025

## Battery life is excellent

Some people don't mind charging their devices a few times a week but I personally loath it.
With the new [Whoop][] and its battery life of ~2 weeks I can finally leave the battery pack when I go on my 1 week work trips and it's _super nice_.

## The app UI is the best

Maybe it's "just" pretty UI but I find Whoop's presentation much more helpful than the rawer presentation that Garmin has.

For example I've always liked to look at sleep information ever since I started wearing an Oura ring and
Whoop's (recently redesigned) presentation is very good as it focuses on actionable metrics:

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/whoop_sleep.png)
![](/images/whoop/garmin_sleep.png)

Whoop to the left focuses on metrics that I can change
while Garmin to the right focuses on sleep stages that I have no idea how to influence.
:::

I also think Whoop is immediately more useful than Garmin's when you open it up:

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/whoop_start.png)
![](/images/whoop/garmin_start.png)

Whoop's landing page to the left and Garmin's on the right.
:::

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/strain_recovery.png)
![](/images/whoop/hours_needed.png)

I'm a sucker for pretty graphs and Whoop has a lot of them.
:::

I have some gripes with the UI---I would like to be able to customize the home screen more for example---but overall I think Whoop's app is a lot
better designed and more useful than any alternative I've tried.

::: note
It's been a few years since I last used Oura but from what I remember their app is also very good.
Just a shame that their exercise tracking is unusable.
:::

## Whoop in the boxers

As I mentioned before, Whoop still thinks that I'm sleeping when I sit with Whoop in the boxers.
Either before I go to bed, after I go to bed, and sometimes it thinks I'm napping when I'm sitting during the day.

Very annoying.

But they're still a killer feature for me because it's the best way to track Submission Grappling.
[Whoop][] is less accurate than the [Polar bicep/chest straps][]
but a biceps band or a chest strap sometimes gets in the way during training,
while I've never noticed the Whoop in my boxers.

![Submission grappling. A version of hugging where you try to strangle each other.](/images/whoop/jones_sub.png)

The Whoop 5.0 / MG also fits the 4.0 boxers well---lucky me as I have a bunch of the older 4.0 boxers.
I've gotta admit, I like their boxers and I kept using them even after I canceled my subscription.

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/boxer_4.0.jpg)
![](/images/whoop/boxer_mg.jpg)

The Whoop MG in the 4.0 boxers to the left and the MG in the new boxers to the right.
:::

I was skeptical to their new design with the "pods" but I think they're an improvement as it's a lot easier to add/remove the Whoop while wearing the boxers,
and if you remove it they're just like regular boxers.
The holders on my old 4.0 boxers have started to peel away and started to chafe but there's no risk for that with the new design.

## ECG

The ECG feature is why I went with Whoop MG instead of Whoop 5.0.

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/ecg2.png)
![](/images/whoop/ecg1.png)

Outputs from Whoop's ECG feature.
It's a little difficult to take an ECG as you need to stay very still---you can see where I moved too much in the top-right picture.
:::

While I've never had any problems with my heart I've had a couple of episodes where I've been very worried that I something was happening.
I had some chest pain and wasn't feeling very well so I hurried to the hospital to get it checked out.

They never found anything and the pain I had was likely "something muscular" but the experience has left me worried.

If the ECG and background "Irregular Heart Rhytm" detection makes me relax a little (or if they do detect something) then I figured it's worth the price jump from the 5.0 to the MG.

::: important
Despite Whoop *MG* hinting at *M*edical *G*rade I'm skeptical about it being medical grade as they make it clear that the neither the ECG nor background AFib detection provides a medical diagnosis.
Maybe it's a marketing sleight of hand that they chose "MG" instead of "Medical Grade"...
:::

## Whoop age

## More measures

Whoop also comes with more "raw" measures that I glance at from time to time:

- Body weight and body composition

  Whoop now syncs with my Withings smart scale and I do need to lose weight; it's nice to have it in the Whoop app so I don't have to open up Withing's app just to see my weight trend.

- Steps

  Again, I have (more accurate) step tracking in Garmin but it's nice to have it all in one app.
  I try to hit a reasonable step goal and step counting---even if inaccurate---has made me try to move around more.

- VO~2~ MAX

  It seems like an important metric but I'm [not sure about it's accuracy][vo2] and it hasn't caused me to change any behaviours.

  [vo2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zcXM1IYtqU

- Blood pressure

  I calibrated the blood pressure insights but I'm not sure how useful it is for me.
  Maybe it can act as an early indicator that my health is deteriorating but so far it's just a pretty statistic.

## Journaling and insights

The journal that correlates your behaviours with your recovery scores is an amazing feature.
_In theory_ this feature alone could carry a device such as Whoop by itself...

If it wasn't for the fact that the usefulness tapers off hard as soon as you learn how the various behaviours affect your body.
At the end of my last subscription I even turned off the journal as it didn't provide any new information and filling it in only became a chore.

Right now I use it but I only track a handful of behaviours that I want to remind myself of.
However, I'll probably turn off the journal in a few months when the newness wears off again.

## Bands

TODO

<https://makerworld.com/en/models/1429739-whoop-4-0-band-to-5-0-mg-adapter#profileId-1486488>

## Pricing

Whoop outdid themselves and the MG took something expensive and made it much more expensive.
While I don't regret going with the more expensive option,
the "Peak" plan (without Blood pressure and ECG) probably makes more sense for most people.
(And truthfully, most people would likely be fine with just a smartwatch anyway.)

Still, it's not deal breaker for me personally.

# Conclusion

Despite its faults and corporate bullshit, the Whoop is still my favorite smart device for fitness and health.
I've tried to find alternatives but nothing has been as convenient or as helpful (or as expensive) as the Whoop.

But maybe in a year I've moved on to try something else.

::: tip
I've heard that some people sync the raw data from a ring, smartwatch, and heart rate monitor with an app, separating the data collection and data processing.
I haven't tried that route yet.
