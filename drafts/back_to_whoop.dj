# A brief history of my experiences with smart devices

I'm not an elite athlete, not even close;
I'm just a programmer who struggles to stay active.
As I also like to play with tech I've tried out various smart devices in the hopes that they can help me to live a healthier life.

Here's the devices I've used, in purchase order:

::: timeline
: Fitbit, before 2020 .smartband

  I had some smartband from Fitbit that I liked.
  When that bugged out I bought the Fitbit Versa, with a square display.

: Oura ring, 2020 .oura

  I wanted to track my sleep better, so I bought a ring.
  It worked well.

: Garmin Vivomove, 2020 .smartband

  The Fitbit kept disconnecting, so I abandoned it for a Garmin band.

: Oura ring Gen 3, 2021 .oura

  I had to recharge the ring all the time so I upgraded to the newer version.

: Withings Body+, 2022 .withings

  I wanted to track my weight so I bought a smart scale.

: Polar Verity Sense, 2022 .hrtracker

  I can't track my BJJ (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu) training with a watch or a ring,
  so I bought a heart rate monitor you put on the bicep.
  It works.

: Fossil Gen 6 Wellness Edition, 2022 .smartwatch

  Maybe I should try a _real_ smartwatch with lots of smart features...?
  I use Android so maybe a watch with WearOS is good?

  (Jokes on me, WearOS was garbage and having to charge the watch every day is a nightmare.
   I went back to the Garmin smartband really quickly.)

: Whoop 4.0, 2023-2024 .whoop

  I used [Whoop][] for a year.
  Tracking BJJ with a device in my underwear is so next level.
  I can also wear it during weight lifting---say goodbye Oura!

: Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, 2024 .smartwatch

  Charging the devices got annoying, maybe there's a better alternative?
  Yes---you charge the Garmin Instinct once a month and it has a _flashlight_.

  Seriously, you haven't truly lived before you've had a flashlight on your watch---it's glorious.
  (Jokes aside, it's awesome.)

: Eight Sleep Pod 4, 2024 .eightsleep

  Sleep is important so [I tried (and returned) a ludicrously expensive smart mattress][].

: Whoop MG, 2025 .whoop

  I was feeling down and I needed something to help me get back to prioritizing fitness and health,
  and I just happened to check back on [Whoop][] just when Whoop MG was released...

  So I threw financial responsibility out the window and ordered the MG on release day.
:::

Right now I'm using the [Garmin Instinct 2X Solar][] as a "stay off my phone" device and [Whoop][] as my fitness and health tracker.
For some people a smartwatch may fulfill both roles, but that's not possible for me as BJJ is my main source of exercise.
I could pair the Polar with my Garmin watch, but then I'd still have to juggle two devices and for me the [Whoop][] is a much more helpful device than the Garmin anyway.

# The point is to change behaviours

The entire point of all of these smart devices is to help me change my behaviours (in a positive way).
It doesn't matter if the device is the most beautiful device God has created;
if it doesn't help me do things differently then it's a failure.

Here are two examples:

1. My first Fitbit smartband was great.

   It's true that it was quite limited in what it could do.\
   Yes, it disconnected from my phone _all the time_ and it was super annoying.\
   And sure, the tracking of steps/calories/steps/etc was wildly inaccurate.

   However, it presented the daily steps/calories/steps as bars on the screen---bars that I should fill over the course of the day---and that caused me to change my behaviours and to move more than I'd have done otherwise.

2. The Garmin Instinct is useful, but not as a fitness or health device.

   I think the watch is very nice;
   it's got a fantastic battery life,
   it's not bothering me when I sleep,
   I don't have to reach for my phone to see if I have any notifications,
   and the flashlight is _amazing_.

   > It’s just super effin’ functional and useful day-to-day, with just as much utility as the flashlight on your phone (if not more, since your hands are still free).
   >
   > ^ [DCRainmaker](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/05/flashlight-multiband-everyone.html)

   The Garmin also has lots of various measurements (and much more accurate than my old Fitbit);
   I can see the daily steps,
   I can follow how my "body battery" is doing,
   I can track walks or runs very well (although I don't run),
   and I can follow my stress and heart rate throughout the days...

   But that doesn't _do_ anything for me.
   I have all these bars and graphs and circles on the watch that I should fill to meet my daily step count for example, but I just don't.

   The Garmin app is also not designed in a way to help me get motivated.
   Maybe it's more geared towards athletes that already train hard every day,
   instead of middle-aged programmers who need that extra push to get out there?

   For whatever reason, as a device to improve my fitness and health, the Garmin is a failure.

# Why I left Whoop last year

About a year ago I chose to not renew my Whoop subscription and I [made a post on Reddit][] explaining why.

Here's a quick summary:

::: dash
* If I had the Whoop in my boxers it thinks I'm sleeping when I sit in front of the computer or lie in the sofa.

* No custom insights for the journal (which is otherwise a great feature).

* The UI for the strength trainer portion of the app sucked.

* It's too expensive if all it provides is tracking for BJJ.
:::

## Has anything changed?

Unfortunately, there's still no custom insights available.

TODO (Still detects me as sleeping with it in the boxers.)

I still dislike the strength trainer with a passion.
You can however start a Weightlifting activity and add the exercises after the training.
This is _much_ more manageable for me and it'll still calculate muscular load for you.

I've also come to realize that after 10 months with just the Garmin,
while the watch was providing all the stats, it wasn't helping me improve my fitness or health in the
way Whoop used to do.
This is the main reason why I was willing to try Whoop once more.

# Whoop screwed over their customers

It was an interesting feeling to visit [r/whoop][] after having placed my order
and see it overrun by people extremely upset about how Whoop was treating their existing subscribers.

I agree that Whoop displayed some real corporate bullshit by telling people to pay an upgrade fee despite claiming for years that upgrades would be free (then walking back on the upgrade fee somewhat),
claiming that the 6-month subscription requirement for new hardware was "a mistake on their blog",
and by breaking compatibility with the 4.0 bands.

Some people claim that Whoop broke the band compatibility intentionally but as I've experienced the same at work I think incompetence is more likely.

> I don't want to be constrained by the old design!
>
> ^ Programmer, before corporate disaster

It sucks but corporations screwing us over in various ways is more or less expected.
This whole situation gave me some regrets for ordering the Whoop so quickly.

# Thoughts on Whoop in 2025

## Sleep/Recovery/Strain

I still really like the Sleep/Recovery/Strain presentation.

Maybe it's "just" pretty UI but I find Whoop's presentation much more helpful than the rawer presentation that Garmin has.

I've always liked to look at sleep information ever since I started wearing an Oura ring and
Whoop's (recently redesigned) presentation is very good as it focuses on actionable metrics:

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/whoop_sleep.png)
![](/images/whoop/garmin_sleep.png)

Whoop to the left focuses on metrics that I can change
while Garmin to the right focuses on sleep stages that I have no idea how to influence.
:::

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/whoop_strain.png)
![](/images/whoop/whoop_recovery.png)

The strain and recovery views (mostly) focuses on actionable targets.
:::

I also like the Whoop app when you open it up:

::: flex
![](/images/whoop/whoop_start.png)
![](/images/whoop/garmin_start.png)

Whoop's landing page to the left is more useful to be than Garmin's on the right.
:::

It's a shame that you can't customize it more
(for example to place the Sleep consistency metric above the fold and de-prioritize the coach)
but overall I think it's well designed and gives me a good overview.

## Body weight

While I've had a Withings smart scale for a while I didn't have a chance to try the integration with Whoop as I canceled my subscription before it was announced.

What can I say, it's nice to have it integrated into one app.

## Steps

> I’m assuming they will likely never count steps because it directly contradicts their messaging and brand for strain. It would send a mixed message to the consumer, in my opinion. I can’t see this happening.
> ^ [Reddit user](https://old.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/plt9jp/will_whoop_ever_count_steps/hccx5tk/)

Surprise, [Whoop added step counting](https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/start-tracking-steps-with-whoop/)
during the time I was away.

> While step counting in isolation is not a good proxy for cardiovascular fitness, a growing and more recent body of scientific research has shown that roughly 8,000 steps per day can reduce the risk of many diseases and conditions.
> ^ [Steps: The newest metric that matters on WHOOP](https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/start-tracking-steps-with-whoop/)

Even though it may not be as accurate as the step counting on Garmin it's nice to have more metrics in a single app,
but it's not anything revolutionary.

## Journaling and insights

## Whoop age

## Blood pressure and ECG

## The new straps and Whoop body

The boxers: less steps and worse sleep detection.

## Pricing

Whoop outdid themselves and the MG took something expensive and made it much more expensive.
While I don't regret going with the more expensive option the "Peak" plan (without Blood pressure and ECG) probably makes more sense for most people.

# I see no real Whoop competitor

Whoop has a unique combination of features

1. A well-designed app that helps me improve my health and fitness
1. Always on, even during weight lifting or BJJ
1. The journaling insights
1. Tracks muscular load

# What I'd like to see from Whoop

* Custom journal entries and insights.

  The journal is one of the killer features of Whoop.
  It can help you identify factors that help or harm your recovery by correlating your behaviour with their recovery score.
