:table-of-content:

I've had my [VORON Trident][trident] for XXX and I've run it for XXX hours.
Overall I'm happy with the printer but I've been itching to make some more mods to it.
Having finally finished the [VORON 0][] ([with mods][zero_mods]) I now have a backup printer I can use to rescue myself when I screw up.

A multi-color solution like the [Enraged Rabbit][ERCF] or the [Box Turtle][] has been sorely missing in my setup.
I started preparing for it with these mods:

A. [Install the Inverted electronics](#Inverted-electronics) mod.

   However, I've been using the [RockNRoll][] mod to give access to the electronics compartment by tilting the printer backwards---a solution that's no longer convenient with a multi-color solution mounted on top of the printer.

   The [Inverted electronics][] solves this by giving access to the electronics compartment without tilting.

A. A filament cutter and filament sensor in the toolhead.

  I've been meaning to switch to another toolhead for a while; since I had to rebuild it anyway why not switch completely?
  This introduced a series of mods:

  a. [Replace the front idlers](#Replacing-the-front-idlers) with the [Beefy Front Idlers][]

  a. Move to an umbilical setup with the [Nitehawk36][]

  a. [Relocate the Y-endstop](#Relocate-the-Y-endstop) to get rid of the Y drag chain

  a. [Install the XOL Carriage](#XOL-carriage)

  a. Use the [A4T-AFC][] filament cutter for the toolhead

  a. Build an extruder with a filament sensor

  a. Use the [Beacon probe][]

  a. Finally, [install the A4T-toolhead](#Installation)

  I guess it spiraled out of control just a little.

A. [Install a nozzle scrubber](#Nozzle-scrubber)

  To automatically clean the nozzle and for a place to park during filament changes.

# [Inverted electronics][]

I've been looking at the [Inverted electronics][] mod even before finishing my Trident printer.
But it wasn't possible with the [Print It Forward][] service I used to print parts for my first 3D printer,
and after the printer was completed I didn't feel the need to redo the wiring again.

# Why the [A4T-toolhead][]?

I've been wanting to replace the Stealthburner toolhead a long time.
It's pretty but the cooling for PLA is quite bad and I it's not convenient to get access to the filament path.

But what to choose?
There are quite a few interesting toolheads I considered:

1. [Dragon Burner][]

  I use the [Dragon Burner][] in [my VORON 0][VORON 0] and using the same toolhead is boring.

1. [Archetype][]

  A pretty fun toolhead and I was considering the [Mjölnir][] version.
  It does require you to flip your XY joints to hang upside down and I couldn't find a filament sensor or filament cutter for it, so I ended up skipping it.

1. [Jabberwocky][]

  An all-in-one toolhead solution that seems to have some quality of life features I think I'd really enjoy:

  > Flip up Extruder. Probably an industry first, a tool-less easy to access toolhead design so that one can access the blade or the filament path for servicing and troubleshooting. This allows a user, in the event of hopefully a rare problem during a filament changing print the ability to access the filament path to clear it of issues and continue with a print job.

  Sadly, the toolhead hasn't been released yet.

1. [XOL][]

  XOL seems like a very well regarded and mature option with tons of support.
  It boasts much better cooling for PLA, which is one of the main reasons I want to migrate away from the Stealthburner.
  I would've gone with XOL if I hadn't discovered the next candidate in this list:

1. [A4T-toolhead][]

  A4T seems similar to XOL, while having even better cooling and a slightly simpler assembly.
  It's a newer project so it's not as mature but I decided to try it anyway.

# Preparing for the umbilical A4T

Before I could move to the [A4T-toolhead][] I had to [install compatible front idlers][] and install a compatible carriage.
For the umbilical setup I also had to move the Y-endstop and setup a holder for the umbilical cable.

## Replacing the front idlers

The [A4T-toolhead][] is wider than the Stealthburner and may collide with the standard front idlers.
I therefore replaced them with the [Beefy Front Idlers][] that should be fully compatible with the [A4T-toolhead][].

## Relocate the Y-endstop

It's easy to move the X-endstop to the toolhead but the LDO Trident kit I bought came with an XY-endstop PCB mounted on the XY rail.
This means there's a single cable running through the Y drag chain that prevents me from removing it.

The solution is to move the Y-endstop to the B motor mount so it doesn't have to move around.
I used [this mod][y-relocation] to avoid having to reprint the B motor mount.

## [XOL carriage][]

I used TAP before so now I needed a new carriage.
I decided to go with the [XOL carriage][] because why not?
Maybe there are some benefits/trade-offs here but I really don't know---I just picked one.

## Hotend

I've been using the Rapido 1 & 2 for both of my printers but I've had a weird issue where it from time to time gets clogged when I print with PLA (both with the Stealthburner and Dragon Burner, with the doors open).

So I wanted to try something new.
I already have an unused Revo (from the LDO VORON Trident kit) and an unused Dragon HF (from the VORON 0 kit).
I've been skeptical of the proprietary nozzles of the Revo and that the Dragon HF has a reputation of heat creep with PLA.

But it's time to try them out.
With a [meltzone extender][] and the cooling in A4T the Dragon HF shouldn't have heat creep problems.
Since the A4T was designed around the Dragon HF I suppose I need to give it a try.

The Revo seems fairly low-maintenance, maybe I'll try it in the VORON 0 instead.

# Nozzle scrubber

I've been wanting a nozzle scrubber [since I built my Trident][purge-bucket] but with VORON Tap I lost too much Y-movement to be able to fit one.
By moving to [Beacon][Beacon probe] I could reclaim some Y-movement to be able to fit a nozzle scrubber.

I found [this version on Printables][nozzle-seal] that includes a Beacon-friendly nozzle scrubber and a place to park your nozzle during filament changes (for when I get my multi-color setup).

# What's next?

I've really been wanting multi color support and I've been waiting for [ERCF][] to be ready for ages.
But I'll probably skip [ERCF][] in favor of the [Box Turtle][] instead as it seems easier to get working.
