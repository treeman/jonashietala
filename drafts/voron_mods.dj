TODO image comparing the old / new

I've had my [VORON Trident][trident] for XXX and I've run it for XXX hours.
Overall I'm happy with the printer but I've been itching to make some more mods to it.
Having finally finished the [VORON 0][] I now have a backup printer I can use to rescue myself when I screw up.

I had two big goals with the mods:

1. Try out a new toolhead
2. Prepare for a multicolor setup

I was thinking of using the [Box Turtle][] as AMS-style filament changer but I was using the [RockNRoll][] mod to give access to the electronics compartment by tilting the printer backwards.
This isn't a great idea if you mount the turtle on top like I planned to do, I instead installed the [Inverted electronics][] mod.

For the new toolhead I opted for the [A4T-toolhead][], with some fun additions such as the [Nighthawk36 toolhead][] for an umbilical setup and the super fast [Beacon probe][].


# [Inverted electronics][]

I've been looking at the [Inverted electronics][] mod even before finishing my Trident printer.
But it wasn't possible with the [Print It Forward][] service I used to build my first 3D printer and after it was completed I didn't feel the need to redo the wiring again.

# The [A4T-toolhead][]

I've been wanting to replace the Stealthburner toolhead a long time.
It's pretty but the cooling for PLA is quite bad and I it's not convenient to get access to the filament path.

But what to choose?
There are quite a few interesting toolheads I considered:

- [Dragon Burner][]

  I use the [Dragon Burner][] in [my VORON 0][VORON 0] and using the same toolhead is boring.

- [Archetype][]

  A pretty fun toolhead and I was considering the [Mjölnir][] version.
  It does require you to flip your XY joints to hang upside down and I couldn't find a filament sensor or filament cutter for it, so I ended up skipping it.

- [Jabberwocky][]

  An all-in-one toolhead solution that seems to have some quality of life features I think I'd really enjoy:

  > Flip up Extruder. Probably an industry first, a tool-less easy to access toolhead design so that one can access the blade or the filament path for servicing and troubleshooting. This allows a user, in the event of hopefully a rare problem during a filament changing print the ability to access the filament path to clear it of issues and continue with a print job.

  Sadly, the toolhead hasn't been released yet.

- [XOL][]

  XOL seems like a very well regarded and mature option with tons of support.
  It boasts much better cooling for PLA, which is one of the main reasons I want to migrate away from the Stealthburner.
  I would've gone with XOL if I hadn't discovered the next candidate in this list:

- [A4T-toolhead][]

  A4T seems similar to XOL, while having even better cooling and a slightly simpler assembly.
  It's a newer project so it's not as mature but I decided to try it anyway.

## [XOL carriage][]

I used TAP before so now I needed a new carriage.
I decided to go with the [XOL carriage][] because why not?

## What hotend to use?

I've been using the Rapido 1 & 2 for both of my printers but I've had a weird issue where it from time to time gets clogged when I print with PLA (both with the Stealthburner and Dragon Burner, with the doors open).

So I wanted to try something new.
I already have an unused Revo (from the LDO VORON Trident kit) and an unused Dragon HF (from the VORON 0 kit).
I've been skeptical of the proprietary nozzles of the Revo and that the Dragon HF has a reputation of heat creep with PLA.

But it's time to try them out.
With a [meltzone extender][] and the cooling in A4T the Dragon HF shouldn't have heat creep problems.
Since the A4T was designed around the Dragon HF I suppose it should be a solid first choice.

The Revo seems fairly low-maintenance but I'll try it in the VORON 0 instead.

## Mount

[Nitehawk36][]

# Move the Y-endstop and remove the drag chains

The X-endstop fit nicely on the toolhead but the LDO Trident kit I bought came with an XY-endstop PCB mounted on the XY rail.
It works well but it requires a drag chain to the XY-carriage.

# What's next?

I've really been wanting multi color support and I've been waiting for [ERCF][] to be ready for ages.
But I'll probably skip [ERCF][] in favor of the [Box Turtle][] instead as it seems easier to get working.
