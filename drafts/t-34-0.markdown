This is an update to the [T-34][] keyboard layout I've been using for a solid number of weeks. While there are more changes I'd like to try, I'm quite pleased with these changes so I figured I might as well immortalize them before I explore further. (And I do have a bunch of big changes I want to experiment with.)

# The repeat key

The big change to the layout is the `Repeat` key. The concept is simple: when you press it you repeat the last pressed key.

The first usage I'm aware of is the [ISRT][] layout which the repeat key to lower the same finger usage. So for example to type "call" you'd type `c` `a` `l` `Repeat`, avoiding the double click on `l`. It's not as bad as pressing a key on the home-row and then directly after pressing a key on the top-row with the same finger, but it's still annoying (especially with the pinky).

So how common is the `Repeat` key? I tried to use my code corpus to see:

![The green bar represents the frequency of each character and the red bars the frequency of a repeated character. `ℛ` is the sum of all the double characters.](/images/t-34-0/repeat-freq.svg)

While the `Repeat` would be commonly used, it does not qualify into the top 10 and so it does not out compete `Space` or `e` as a thumb key. (`Space` isn't listed in the graph so `d` comes in at 10th place.)

But it's usefulness isn't only in minimizing SFB, as it can easily repeat difficult keys as well. For instance I have many two- or three-key combos, and double tapping them are *not* pleasant. I tried to solve this by holding them down to simulate double or triple taps, but with a repeat key I can just do `combo` + `Repeat`. Feels good!

Or I can repeat modded keys. For instance to exit Elixir's REPL IEx you need to do `Ctrl` + `c` twice. I don't like to hold down layer keys (I use one-shot layers and mods instead) so to type `Ctrl` + `c` I press `Mod`, `Ctrl`, `c`, with no pauses. To do this twice I would either need 6(!) keypresses, or using hold: `Mod`, `Ctrl` (hold), `c`, `c`. With the repeat key it's 4 taps, without any holds: `Mod`, `Ctrl`, `c`, `Repeat`.

Of course you can repeat whatever you like, such as `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Tab` or `Shift` + `Gui` + `c` (close window in XMonad) as well.

So `Repeat` seems like a good idea---as long as we can find a nice place for it.


# Base layer

The changes from the [previous version](/blog/2021/06/03/the-t-34-keyboard-layout#base-layer):

Introducing the `Repeat` key caused a bunch of changes to the layout:

1. Introduce the `Repeat` key itself.

1. Swap `a`/`Repeat` and `i`/`u`.

   This was a change I made even before `Repeat` (with `.` in it's place). It was a suggestion from [/u/phbonachi](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/nrl8dy/the_t34_keyboard_layout/h0ltgkx/) on Reddit, as `u` and `i` was much more common so they should go on the stronger middle finger.

   This doesn't hold as much with `Repeat`, but having `Repeat` on the middle doesn't work well as it's awkward to press `l` with the index and then `Repeat` with the middle, which is the most common double bigram.

1.  Rotate `.`, `,`.

    `.` is the more common, so it goes in the more convenient spot.

1. Move `"` and `=` to combos, and place `/` on base.

   It's true that `"` is more common than `/`, but now takes the relatively convenient three-key combo on the home-row. `/` is used a lot in paths, which caused a bunch of issues with it's previous three-key combo placement.

   To make room for `Repeat`, I had to move another symbol away from base. I chose to move `=` to a combo, as it's not that common (I have other solutions for `=>`, `!=` etc), and the combo is still convient for the main use-case of ` = `.

The big decision point is where to place `Repeat`, the other changes more or less fall out afterwards.

Easiest would be to place it on a primary thumb---but it's not even close as frequent as `Space` or `e` is. It might work on a secondary thumb, but that requires me to rework my mod and symbol setup, which I'm not keen to do.

It's also not quite frequent enough to warrant a position on the home-row for me, but it should be in the home-box (as in not on the edges).

I think I found a decent position. It's not perfect, as words such as `falla` (to fall) cannot be typed comfortably with `Repeat`, and I have to double tapping `l` (or worse `Repeat` then `a`, which my brain wants to do). Still, neither `a`, `.`, `u`, `i` nor `(` are commonly followed by `Repeat`, so in practice it works out decently well.

There's another change I made that's unrelated to `Repeat`, that aims to fix some issues I complained about in my [previous writeup](/blog/2021/06/03/the-t-34-keyboard-layout#is-this-the-perfect-layout):

- Rotate `y`, `k`, `j`, `p`.

  To have `j` and `k` (up/down in Vim) in slightly better positons and to fix the troublesome `sys` and `bj` pairs.

- Rollling `u` `Repeat` outputs `ui` to fix bigram

                                       `u` + `,`        `Reverse repeat`

# Reverse repeat

Reverse Repeat, bidirectional pairs:

A                   B
--------------      ----------------
`Ctrl` `n`          `Ctrl` `p`
`*`                 `#`
`Ctrl` `o`          `Ctrl` `i`
`W`                 `B`

Any other letter, pressing `Reverse Repeat` output the previous letter + `a`. This is 


# Symbols

The changes to [the symbols](/blog/2021/06/03/the-t-34-keyboard-layout#mods-symbols) are to move `@`, `.`, `,`, `"`, `/`, `=` and `Repeat` mirroring the changes to the base layer.

# Numbers

The changes to [the num layer](/blog/2021/06/03/the-t-34-keyboard-layout#where-are-the-digits) are again to mirror the changes to the base layer.

![Num layer, gray keys turns of the NUMWORD temporary layer](/images/t-34-0/num.png)

In Vim you can type `20k` or `13j` to move up 20 lines or down 13 lines. Having the number layer turn off after `k` or `j` is therefore very convenient. `x` does not turn off the layer, so you can easily type `800x600` or similar.

I won't list it here, but `j` and `k` are also moved in the [workspace nav layer](/blog/2021/06/03/the-t-34-keyboard-layout#navigation).


# Tap hold

I am a happy [Auto Shift][] user, where you hold down a key until the shifted variant appears. While I use the [qmk][] firmware, I have my own "tap hold" implementation with some extra features:

1. Variable per-key timing.

   The standard implementation has one timing for all keys, which I found was super annoying as my pinkies are slow---leading to a high timeout setting to avoid accidental shifts---but then shifting would be annoyingly slow with the other faster fingers.

   Right now I use a 100 ms timeout for the index and middle finger, but a 135 ms timeout for the pinkies.

1. The other big feature is a customizable hold action.

   While auto shift only shifts the underlying keycode, you could send whatever you want. I currently use it to simplify the input of some programming constructs:

   Tap             Hold
   -----           ------      -----
   `|`             ` || `      One hold saves 4 key strokes for these common operators
   `&`             ` && `
   `=`             ` == `
   `!`             ` != `
   `@`             `@u`        Vim: Execute macro stored in `u` (matching the `qu` combo)
   `?`             `{:?}`      Rust debug print
   `#`             `{:#?}`     Rust debug pretty print
   `%`             `%{}`       A map in Elixir

   (I previously used this feature only to input double or triple symbols.)

1. Interopability with CAPSWORD/NUMWORD, `Repeat` and the ability to shift `åäö`.

# What do I dislike?

- `p` is in *the* worst spot on the keyboard, and it's not that rare to deserve such a bad position. (In fact I might ditch that key position completely, as it's the only position I have to move my entire hand to reach.)
- Having `space` combo all symbols is a bit weird as the left mod only covers symbols on the right side, and it messes up my head. I'm considering to change so that `space` + key on the left = number and `space` + key on the right = symbol, and the reverse for `e`.
- `Repeat` being on the same column as `a` and `5` isn't ideal. I'd like to try with `Repeat` on the secondary left-hand thumb, and to move the mods to combos instead.
- The `!` combo is a bit awkward as the index and thumb come very close together.

And now, with this post out of the way, I can start the next round of experimentation.
