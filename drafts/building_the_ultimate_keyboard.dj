TODO picture of the keyboard

:table-of-content:

What comes to mind when you see the description "the ultimate keyboard"?

There are _many_ keyboards in this world; here are that might fit the "ultimate" moniker:

- [Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate mechanical keyboard][das-ultimate]
- [DataHand][]
- [Ergodox EZ][ergo-ez]
- [Glove80][g80]
- [Happy Hacking Keyboard][hhkb]
- [Model M Keyboard][model-m]
- [Stenotype][] keyboards.
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard][uhk]
- [CharaChorder][]

Some even have "ultimate" in their name, although I'll assert that they're far from ultimate.

> Any man who must say, "I am the King", is no true king.
> ^ Tywin Lannister

I'll go one step further to say that no keyboard is universally the ultimate because it's impossible to agree on how to rank different keyboards.
For example, while I personally prefer a split keyboard, you might not;
some people have very long fingers and some have very short fingers, making some layouts more preferable.
Others may not even have 10 fingers (or both hands), requiring more drastic modifications.

If an ultimate keyboard exists, it differs from person to person.
This is my attempt to build an ultimate keyboard for myself.

# My wishlist

To me, the ultimate keyboard should have these features:

a. Should be split to support a more natural typing position.

   Really the biggest ergonomical leap in my opinion.

a. Customized for my own fingers and typing eccentricities.

   Column stagger, curvatures and tenting are features I think I want but they need to be tuned, probably by trial-and-error.
   The position of the thumb keys is another sticking point that the other keyboards I've tried have failed to get right.

a. Have an integrated trackball or trackpad.

   This way I don't have to move my hand so far and I can free up some valuable desk space.
   It shouldn't be operated with my thumb due to my RSI.

a. Contain the keys I need but no more.

   I like smaller keyboards and I've been very happy and with [my custom keyboard layout][t34] that only has 34 keys.
   Some modifications are fine of course.

With these requirements I need to be able to customize all parts of the keyboard and I really don't want to learn CAD and create one from scratch; I wonder what alternatives I have?

# [Cosmos][] keyboard configurator

Having looked around, I probably want something similar to a [Dactyl][] / [Dactyl Manuform][] (many variants exists).
They're keyboards you generate from parameters (such as number of rows and columns and the amount of curvature).
I've always wanted to try one and now [with a 3D printer](/series/voron_trident), I can.

When looking for a generator I stumbled upon the [Cosmos keyboard configurator][Cosmos] and I want to gush about it a little because {=it's excellent=}.

![A relatively standard Dactyl Manuform with an encoder and trackpad.](/images/cosmos/cosmos_config.png)

It's excellent because it allows a clueless sod like me to configure a keyboard the way I want to and it has an impressive feature list:

1. Easily generate keyboards of any size.
1. Customize XY-spacing, row- and colomn curvature, and more.
1. Several pre-made thumb clusters.
1. UI to move around all the keys.
1. Supports different switches (I so [need my Choc switches](#I-like-Choc-switches)).
1. An `Expert` mode that allows you to customize anything via JavaScript.
1. Supports encoders, trackpads, OLED displays, and trackballs.
1. Can generate a wrist rest.
1. Exports `.stl` for easy printing or `.step` you can import to CAD.

In the `Expert` mode you lose the nice UI but you can instead customize the keyboard using Javascript.
Here's a small snippet from the tool:

```javascript
const curvature = {
  curvatureOfColumn: 15,
  curvatureOfRow: 5,
  spacingOfRows: 18, // 18x19 Choc spacing
  spacingOfColumns: 19,
  arc: 0,
};

/**
 * Useful for setting a different curvature
 * for the pinky keys.
 */
const pinkyCurvature = {
  ...curvature,
  curvatureOfColumn: 15,
};

/**
 * The plane used to position the upper keys.
 * It's rotated by the tenting and x rotation
 * then translated by the z offset.
 */
const upperKeysPlane = new Trsf()
   // `20` specifies the tenting angle.
  .rotate(20, [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], false)
  .rotate(1, [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], false)
  .translate(0, 0, 0, false);
```

The entire state of the keyboard is also stored in the url, so I can easily share my config by [including a link][final-version].
(Barring any breaking changes in the tool of course...)

# Initial design parameters

Even with a keyboard configurator I needed a way to start.
I already have a [layout that I really like][t34] so I wasn't starting from nothing.
These were the important parts going into the design process:

1. A 3x5 grid with 1-2 thumb keys (in practice one thumb key is enough).
1. Integrated trackball on the right-hand side.
1. Use [Choc switches](#I-like-Choc-switches).

If you question why I want to build such a small keyboard I'll redirect you to the discussion in [The T-34 keyboard layout][t34-discussion] post.

# I like Choc switches

One of the major decisions with a keyboard is what kind of switch to use.
While MX-style switches are the most common I personally really love Choc switches for a couple of reasons:

::: plus
- Low-profile
- Low actuation force
- Can be closer together
:::

While a low profile switch is more important for a flat keyboard, not a tented and curved one like I'm building now,
the flatter keycaps and the switches being closer together is crucial for pressing two keys with one finger:

::: flex
![](/images/cosmos/compo_no_press.jpg)
![](/images/cosmos/combo_press.jpg)

A horizontal combo is pressed with the finger in the middle of the keys. It's surprisingly comfortable.
:::

The low-actuation force is also more comfortable to me, helps reduce the strain on my fingers, and makes combos (pressing several switches at once) generally more pleasant to use.

## Different kinds of switches

![](/images/cosmos/choc_switches.jpg)

But what kind of Choc switch should I use?
Should it be [linear][], [tactile][sunset], or [clicky][]?
Exactly how heavy should they be?
Should they be [silent][]?

I wasn't sure so I ordered a sampling of different switches to try.

For the final keyboard I used the [Ambients silent Noctural (linear / 20gf)][silent] switches,
although the only factor I ended up caring about was getting as light switches as possible.
(I've previously used modded 15gf switches, which were even better, but I couldn't find a way to buy them.)

## Keycaps

![It's hard to decide on a colorscheme so I [bought a bunch of random colors][keycaps].](/images/cosmos/choc_keycaps.jpg)

Keycaps aren't only for looking cool.
A convex keycap for the thumb button instead of the standard concave one makes it much more comfortable:

![The blue convex keycap to the left and the red concave to the right.](/images/cosmos/keycaps_concave_convex.jpg)

I also got keycaps for the index row with these small [homing notches][keycaps-homing] to help my fingers more easily find the home row.

[keycaps-homing]: https://splitkb.com/collections/switches-and-keycaps/products/mbk-pbt-coloured-blank-keycaps?variant=47289185632603

# Additional hardware

It's not enough with just a 3D printer, you also need some hardware:

- Switches
- Keycaps
- TRRS connector + cable
- Liatris microcontroller
- Trackball + sensor
- Some screws and cables

# Prototypes

![Discarded prototypes.](/images/cosmos/prototype_cases.jpg)

When you're trying to design something like a custom keyboard I think you need to go through a bunch of trial-and-error until you find something that fits.

Here's a short rundown of some of the significant revisions I went through, mostly to illustrate that it's very much an iterative process.

::: note
When I first started this process the [Cosmos][] keyboard configurator didn't support generating both halves at the same time, so I focused on getting the right side comfortable first.
:::

## First print

{% v2 %}

For my first print I mostly wanted to print it out and test how a keyboard with a standard curvature felt.
I also wanted to try to place a trackball somewhere.

I ended up removing a regular thumb key (I've used two thumb keys with my [keyboard layout](/series/t-34)) to make it fit and I added a "mouse thumb key" that I plan to use as a `left mouse button` when I'm operating the trackball.
It was tricky to place the trackball as I wanted to operate it with my index + middle finger, not my thumb.

Another tweak I made was to reduce the spacing between the keys to be closer to the Choc spacing.
Choc spacing seems to be 18.6 x 17.6 mm, but I used 19 x 18 mm spacing---the attraction to round numbers is real.

![This is the very first prototype I printed.
Please ignore the bad print quality; the filament was wet and the temperature was too high. It's just a prototype so it really doesn't matter.](/images/cosmos/v2_proto.jpg)

[Cosmos reference][v2-ball],

## Pressing the top right key with the ring finger

{% v3 %}

Most of the keys on the keyboard felt fine but I had one major annoyance: 
I have a habit of using the ring finger to press the top right key instead of the pinky but with the curvature on the keyboard this just wasn't possible anymore.

You might wonder, why don't I just create a new habit and use the pinky _as you're supposed to_?
The simple answer is that I *hate* it.
To my fingers that feels beyond terrible and I'd rather remove the key and only have two keys in the outermost column.
As it happens, pressing the key with my ring finger (on a flat keyboard) feels good so I'd rather adjust the key than remove it.

::: important
That's the beauty of designing a custom keyboard for yourself---you can do weird shit that only makes sense to you.
:::

![The second printed prototype, with some keys installed for testing.
The printer clogged before the print was finished but it did its job as a prototype.](/images/cosmos/v3_proto.jpg)

![Here's an angle from the configurator showing the offset of the `p` key compared the other keys in the column.](/images/cosmos/v3_p_ring_finger.png)

I also added an extra mouse thumb key and lowered the pinky column a bit.

[Cosmos reference][v3]

## Adjust mouse keys and increase tenting

{% v4 + v5 + v6 %}

![It's starting to look like an actual keyboard.
With color coded keycaps; red for mouse-only buttons and violet for the home-row keys.](/images/cosmos/v6_proto.jpg)

Pressing `p` with my ring finger feels great.
Pressing the thumb normal thumb key feels awful because the mouse thumb keys are in the way when I relax my hand.

Adjustments made:

::: plus
- Moved mouse thumb keys to be more vertical and pressed from the side.
- Added an extra pinky key reachable when I'm using the trackball.
- Increased tenting to 20 degrees from 10 degrees.
:::

![20 degrees of tenting.](/images/cosmos/v6_config.png)

## Rounded base and pinky tweak

![Yet another prototype.](/images/cosmos/v8_proto.jpg)

::: plus
- I tried the "rounded" sides and top feature of [Cosmos][].
- The mouse pinky key was too low, I raised it up a bunch.
:::

## Thumb keys adjustments

![](/images/cosmos/v9_proto.jpg)

::: plus
- Rotated the main thumb key inwards
- Added an area for a display
:::
::: dash
- Lowered the mouse thumb keys a little
- Removed the "rounded" features
:::

## More tweaks and the left half

![](/images/cosmos/v11_proto.jpg)

::: plus
- Configure the left half of the keyboard
- Move pinky keys a little upwards
- Move all thumb keys a little further away
:::
::: dash
- Removed the display
:::

## Beta V3

At this point the Beta V3 of [configurator][Cosmos] is out and in it there's several improvements, most notably:

::: plus
- Both halves can be configured at the same time.
- Can go between the Advanced and Expert tabs! WOW!

  I had to manually keep track of the JavaScript changes I made, and update them manually if I wanted to make a change in the UI...
  But no more!
:::

I had to redo most of the configuration and I think I made some minor changes that I didn't keep track of, but I made two larger ones:

::: dash
- Lowered the tenting angle to 15 degrees (from 20)
- Lowered ring pinky column key a little
:::

![](/images/cosmos/v12_proto.jpg)

## Small tweaks to pinky and thumb keys

::: plus
- Raise/tilt top pinky row key
- Move thumb keys on left side closer together
:::

![](/images/cosmos/v13_proto.jpg)

## Final prototype

I did make some more minor tweaks for the final prototype...
But I can't remember, probably some small changes to the thumb or top pinky keys again.

![Behold, it's finally and completely done!](/images/cosmos/v14_proto_both.jpg)

::: note
After having used the keyboard for typing...
I notice that it might not be done.

But I'm too lazy to redo the wiring at this point time.

Here's a list of things that bothers me:

1. The mouse pinky key is sometimes in the way when typing (I should lower it or maybe _\*gasp\*_ remove it).
1. The inner thumb keys on both sides are very difficult to use.
1. I have no use of the bottom extra two keys on the left side (ring and middle finger column).

Maybe I'll find a use for the extra keys in the future but having unused keys _annoys_ me.
:::

## Wrist rests

![Some of the different wrist rests I tried.](/images/cosmos/prototype_rests.jpg)

::: important
While they're called a _wrist_ rests, I don't think you should hold your arms so that there's pressure on the wrist as that can easily lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.
Surprisingly this is even worse with a softer support but I don't want to risk it either way.

I think of them more as _palm_ rests, where I rest the lower part of the palm on the rest, making sure the wrist itself doesn't receive any pressure.

# Wiring

## Matrix

::: flex
![](/images/cosmos/left_wiring.jpg)
![](/images/cosmos/right_wiring.jpg)
:::

![The rows are connected with diodes and with a cable to a pin on the controller.](/images/cosmos/left_rows_soldered.jpg)

![The matrix on the right keyboard.
It was a lot more difficult to solder because of the awkward positions of the switches.](/images/cosmos/right_matrix.jpg)

![Both the rows and columns are wired up and soldered to the controller.](/images/cosmos/left_matrix.jpg)

The wiring is horrible, I know.

I only lost one microcontroller due to a short...
With my wiring prowess I consider that a success!

## TRRS & handedness

{path="config.h"}
```c
#define SPLIT_HAND_PIN GP1
```

![The TRRS connector is connected to Vcc, GND, and pin 2 (and similarly on the right side).
Pin 1 is also connected to Vcc to signal to QMK that this is the left side of the keyboard, whereas pin 1 is connected to GND on the right controller.
](/images/cosmos/left_micro_soldered.jpg)

## Trackball

TODO

![](/images/cosmos/liatris.webp)

# Adding the keyboard to QMK

The QMK cli has the `qmk new-keyboard` command that helps you get started.
I couldn't get the generated template to work for me, so I copied settings from an existing keybord with `rp2042` support.

I'll try to hit on the most important parts of the config, take a [look at the source code][cybershard] for all details.

## Basic setup

The folder structure for a keyboard looks like this:

{path="qmk_firmware/keyboards"}
```
cybershard
├── keyboard.json
├── rules.mk
└── keymaps
    └── default
        ├── config.h
        ├── keymap.c
        └── ...
```

({=Cybershard=} is the name I eventually settled on for the keyboard.)

The most important part is `keyboard.json` that defines (almost) everything we need for a new keyboard in QMK.

First you need to set the `processor`, `bootloader`, and `usb` values.
The [Liatris][] microcontroller uses the [RP2040](https://docs.qmk.fm/platformdev_rp2040) MCU, and I just picked some vendor- and product identifiers:

{path="keyboard.json"}
```json
{
    "keyboard_name": "cybershard",
    "processor": "RP2040",
    "bootloader": "rp2040",
    "usb": {
        "device_version": "0.0.1",
        "pid": "0x0002",
        "vid": "0x0361"
    },
}
```

Then we need to define the matrix (with the pins we soldered) and the layout (how we'll configure the keymap in `keymap.c`):

{path="keyboard.json"}
```json
{
    "diode_direction": "COL2ROW",
    "matrix_pins": {
        // We need to use a `GP` prefix for the pins.
        "rows": ["GP26", "GP27", "GP22", "GP20"],
        "cols": ["GP3", "GP4", "GP5", "GP6", "GP7"]
    },
    "layouts": {
        "LAYOUT": {
            "layout": [
                // First physical row
                { "matrix": [1, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 1], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 2], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 3], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 4], "x": 0, "y": 0 },

                // Second row
                { "matrix": [2, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 1], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 2], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 3], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [1, 4], "x": 0, "y": 0 },

                // etc...
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Note that we can pick whatever physical pins we want as we can move around and configure them in software.
The `LAYOUT` macro is what we use in `keymap.c` to define our keymap.
When defining it we can choose to skip certain keys and reorganize it to be easier to define; for example, there's no switch at `0,0` in my keyboard so I skip that.

The above `LAYOUT` can then be used like this:

{path="keymap.c"}
```c
LAYOUT(
 SE_J,    SE_C,    SE_Y,    SE_F,    SE_P,
 SE_R,    SE_S,    SE_T,    SE_H,    SE_K,
 SE_COMM, SE_V,    SE_G,    SE_D,    SE_B,
          SE_A,    SE_B,
                            // Thumb keys
                            FUN_CLR, MT_SPC,
),
```

## Flashing

With the above setup we should be able to flash the keyboard by first entering the boot loader and running:

```fish
qmk flash -kb cybershard -km default
```

::: tip
I didn't add a reset button to the keyboard that you typically use to enter the boot loader.
The [Liatris][] has a boot button that you can hold when you connect the keyboard, but I want to hide the controller inside the casing.

QMK has a `QK_BOOT` key that does the same.
I added it as a 5-finger [combo][] to make it easy to press but difficult to press by accident.
:::

Now the process of updating the firmware is quite nice and unless I screw up I don't need to connect another keyboard to do it.

1. Start flashing with `qmk flash` (it will wait until it finds a flashable target).
2. Press the `QK_BOOT` combo (the keyboard becomes unresponsive).
3. Wait until the script finishes and the keyboard is available again.

::: note
`qmk flash` didn't work for me and it always got stuck at:

```
Flashing for bootloader: rp2040
Waiting for drive to deploy...
```

After some digging around I found that all you're doing is copying a `.uf2` file into a usb storage, and the controller will then reboot as a keyboard with _something_ like this:

```fish
qmk compile -kb cybershard -km default
sudo mount /dev/sdf1 /media/sd
sudo cp cybershard_default.uf2 /media/sd/
```

After more frustration I found out that the flash scripts looks for a file called `INFO_UF2.TXT` under all drives mounted below `/media`.
Because my system doesn't mount usb drives by default the script would never find it and hang.

The simple solution is to start mounting usb drives automatically, which I did by installing [udevil](https://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil/) and running `devmon` on system startup.
:::

## Split keyboard

To get the split keyboard feature to work I had to set the `SERIAL_DRIVER` option in `rules.mk`:

{path="rules.mk"}
```make
SERIAL_DRIVER = vendor
```

{path="keyboard.json"}
```json
{
    "split": {
        "enabled": true,
        // The pin that signals if the current controller is the left (high)
        // or right (low) controller.
        "handedness": {
            "pin": "GP1"
        },
        // The TRRS data pin.
        "soft_serial_pin": "GP2",
        "matrix_pins": {
            "right": {
                // We can override the pins for the right controller.
                // Note that GP26 and GP27 are swapped compared to the left side
                // due to a mistake I made when soldering.
                "rows": ["GP27", "GP26", "GP22", "GP20"],
                "cols": ["GP3", "GP4", "GP5", "GP6", "GP7"]
            }
        },
        "transport": {
            "sync": {
                // We need to sync the matrix state to allow combos, mods, and
                // other stuff to work.
                "matrix_state": true
            }
        }
    },
    "layouts": {
        "LAYOUT": {
            // The rows 0 to 3 specifies rows on the left side and
            // 4 to 7 the rows on the right side.
            "layout": [
                // These 5 keys are the first row on the left side.
                { "matrix": [1, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 1], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 2], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 3], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [0, 4], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                // These 5 keys are the first row on the right side.
                { "matrix": [4, 0], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [4, 1], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [4, 2], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [4, 3], "x": 0, "y": 0 },
                { "matrix": [5, 4], "x": 0, "y": 0 },

                // etc..
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The `LAYOUT` macro is just a function with many arguments but with the right order it can be formatted
to look similar to the physical keyboard.
This is for example the base layer of my keyboard:

```c
LAYOUT(
 // Left side                                    // Right side
 SE_J,    SE_C,    SE_Y,    SE_F,    SE_P,       SE_X,    SE_W,    SE_O,    SE_U,    SE_DOT,
 SE_R,    SE_S,    SE_T,    SE_H,    SE_K,       SE_M,    SE_N,    SE_A,    SE_I,    REPEAT,
 SE_COMM, SE_V,    SE_G,    SE_D,    SE_B,       SE_SLSH, SE_L,    SE_LPRN, SE_RPRN, SE_UNDS,
          SE_A,    SE_B,
                            // Left thumb keys   // Right thumb key
                            FUN_CLR, MT_SPC,     SE_E,
                                                 // Mouse thumb keys          // Mouse pinky
                                                 SE_X,    KC_BTN1,                   KC_BTN2
