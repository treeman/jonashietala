> A good writer isn't born; a good writer is created
{ :epigraph }

It may sound dumb, but one of my reasons for writing a book was to improve my writing ability.
Maybe I could've practiced on the blog instead, but putting things on paper gave it some added weight I don't I would've gotten otherwise.

Here are some of my most important writing takeaways I've gotten from the process of writing a book.
These aren't original by any means, just things I've collected during the process.
Many lessons are from the excellent book [On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction][writing-well] that I can't recommend highly enough.

# Writing is a skill

The most important thing to remember is that writing is a skill.
A skill can be improved, but it will take conscious effort.

## Deliberate practice

Like any skill, the best way to improve it is to *practice*.
Without practice, everything else is meaningless.

But it's not enough to "just write", you also need to evaluate your progress and try to notice what you're lacking and where you can improve.

Be introspective, think about what you're doing and be your own critic.
This is an extremely valuable skill, which will helpful for you no matter what you want to improve upon.

It can be difficult, so here are some questions I try to ask myself whenever I write:

- Does the text flow nicely?
- Where is the red thread?
- Are you making the case succinctly, or is there lots of fluff?
- What is the purpose of this section/chapter/paragraph?
- Can I remove these words?
- Am I repeating myself?
- Can I replace any of these words to make it simpler, more succinct or more correct?
- Does the text sound good?
- Are the sentences too short? Too long?
- Is there sufficient variation in the text?
- Are you [using the character types][types]; commas, ellipses, hyphens, dashes and brackets?


## Remove unnecessary words

My biggest takeaway from [On Writing Well][writing-well] is that if you can remove a word or two from a sentence, it's probably a good idea to do so.

1. Quite often we use extra words that don't really add anything of value.
1. We often use extra words that don't add anything of value.
1. We often use redundant words.

It's not wise to go overboard, but for me it's been a very helpful idea to keep in mind.
If I'm not strict on myself I've found that I'm very good at adding redundant words everywhere.

## Keep it simple stupid

KISS, a common acronym in software development that is applicable to writing too.
Complexity is an alluring mistress, especially for the bright and motivated,
but using simpler words and sentence structures is often the better way.

This is especially true in non-fiction where you're trying to explain a technical concept.
By keeping things simpler---often simpler than you'd like---your explanation will be more easily understood by more people.

The reader will be tasked hard enough to understand the subject matter at hand, throwing complicated jargon at them will only make it harder.

Yes, it's difficult to explain a hard subject in simple terms.

## Be sure, and make it personal

One common piece of advice I'd like to push back on is to keep the technical writing dry and impersonal.
The advice is to avoid "you", "in my opinion" and to hedge your bets with "maybe", "there's a chance" and "occasionally".

It's much more memorable and interesting to expose your personal opinions and to use strong wording.
Be confident.

If you point out every exception to the rule and add dozens of qualifiers to every statement, you will muddy the water so much that the core message will be drowned out.

Instead, focus to deliver the core message to the best of your abilities.
Deliver it with confidence, then the reader will remember it.
Make it colorful.
Show your personality; make it interesting, make it funny, and make it memorable.

Write like a Chad!

# Consistency is the most important thing

If you're going to write a larger piece of work like a book, the most important thing is consistency.

Anyone can write when motivation runs high, but what separates the wheat from the chaff is if you write when you're not motivated.
It's exactly like exercising; the people who gets results are those who go to the gym every time or who go out for a run even when it's raining like mad.

It's comforting to think about very successful authors who only write with the help of inspiration, but I think it's a trap.

[A Song of Ice and Fire][] is my favorite book series, but I'm sure that if George R. R. Martin had been more focused on writing consistently---instead of waiting for inspiration---we wouldn't be here still waiting for the next book a decade later, worried that he'll die before he finishes the series.

And he's not alone. [The Gentlemen Bastard][] series is just as good, but we've been waiting a decade for the next book there too.

Do yourself a favor and turn yourself into an author that grinds out results, not one who waits for inspiration to strike.
The trick is, you can "force" inspiration to come by forcing yourself into writer mode.
And the way to do that is by making it a habit.

TODO what worked for me...

# Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite

One thing that may hinder the writing process is that the output isn't great the first time.
Most of the time it's just bad, but often it plainly sucks.
And that's hard to handle, because we don't want it to suck.
We want it to be great!

I think the key here is to let go.
Allow it to suck, as long as we get *something* down to work with.
Then you'll move forward and allow yourself to get into writer mode where the words will flow.

It's only then that the real writing can start: **the rewrite**.

I really think that changing, revising, rewriting, and refactoring is the key to writing well.
It's the rewrite that will allow you to:

1. Make the text fluent.
1. Make the writing consistent.
1. Find and fix errors, both large and small.
1. Reduce fluff.
1. Ensure that the core message is delivered as clearly and strongly as possible.

In my mind the rewrite is like polishing a gem.
Without it, the gem is not much more than a glittering rock---
you can see the potential, but it's nothing special.
Yet after the polish it will sparkle and captivate you.

The rewrite is essential to good writing.

# Clarity of thought translates into clear writing

# Have a plan and an outline

# Get a proof-reader or two

# Perfectionism is a blessing and a curse
