Abstract
--------

Recommendations are becoming more and more important in a world where there is an abundance of possible choices and e-commerce and content providers are featuring recommendations prominently. Recommendations based on *explicit feedback*, where user is giving feedback for example with ratings, has been a popular research subject. *Implicit feedback* recommender systems which passively collects information about the users is an area growing in interest. It makes it possible to generate recommendations based purely from a user's interactions history without requiring any explicit input from the users, which is commercially useful for a wide area of businesses. This thesis builds a recommender system based on implicit feedback using the recommendation algorithms *katz-eig* and *link-analysis* and analyzes and implements strategies for learning optimized parameters for different datasets. The resulting system forms the foundation for Comordo Technologies' commercial recommender system.
