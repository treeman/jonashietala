This series documents my journey building my very first 3D printer: a [VORON Trident 250][trident].

I'm not a 3D printer expert---in fact I'm a complete beginner and I've never even held a 3D printed part in my hand before---so don't expect any deep insights from this series.
Instead I'll try to document my progress, write about problems I encounter, contain lots of pictures, and will hopefully end with an awesome printer.
