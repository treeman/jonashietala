TODO

Code
----

* Games
    * Downloadable files (should just add links... but where are the files?)
* 404 - Some funky thing. A game perhaps?
* Sitemap (How to autogenerate??)
* HTML5  
    * Pandoc: <http://hub.darcs.net/co-dan/website/browse/site.hs#214>
    * Modernizer or similar to show html 5 tags for older browsers?
* .txt version of things
    * Only tags left! Seems fruitless

Misc
----

* Prettier color scheme/design!
* Check header tags in posts? Some are too low.
* Update sitemap

Write
-----

* Recommendations
    * Link to posts describing the best books/series!

Design
------

* Code
    * background
    * font
* Correct usage of html5 etc.
* Post headers. Date? Title?
* Color scheme
