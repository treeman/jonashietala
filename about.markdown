Hi! I'm Jonas Hietala. I currently work at [Configura][] as a system developer following my masters in Computer Science at [Linköpings University][liu].

This is my personal blog where I can practice my writing; Mostly about things currently happening in my life. I like to build different things, for a few examples check out the [projects][] page and my [github][] account. You can find the source to this site [here][site-source].

I also like to [read][], play [games][] and to practice Taekwon-do.
